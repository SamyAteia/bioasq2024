./datasets contains the files that were used for training QLora adapters and also for few-shot learning.  
./model_weights contains the downloaded model weights from the fireworks fine-tuning service. You don't have to necesarely use them on your own hardware as the models were also published via the fireworks API and should be accessable from your own fireworsk account, but you have to deploy them in your fireworks account first.

For the OpenAI fine-tuned models no model weights are available and the models cannot be made public as of now.
