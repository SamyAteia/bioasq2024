Cross-sectional. To assess the reliability and validity of the French version of the Spinal Cord Injury Pain Instrument (SCIPI) and to determine its performance versus \"Douleur Neuropathique 4 questions\" (DN4) in diagnosing neuropathic pain (NeuP). Clinique romande de r\u00e9adaptation, spinal cord injury (SCI) center in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Backward and forward translation in French of the 4-item\u00a0SCIPI were performed by native speakers in both languages. Thirty persons with SCI were included in the validation study. Internal consistency was measured with the Kuder-Richardson (KR-20) coefficient. Cohen's kappa coefficients were used to assess the test-retest reliability and the agreement between SCIPI and DN4. Clinical assessment was used as the reference standard to diagnose NeuP. The area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUROC) was used to assess the performance of diagnostic tests. KR-20 coefficient of internal consistency was 0.50 (95% CI 0.26, 0.74). Test-retest reliability coefficient was 0.86 (95% CI 0.76, 0.95). The best cutoff value was 2 points, resulting a sensitivity of 88% (95% CI 69%, 98%) and a specificity of 92% (95% CI 75%, 99%). SCIPI had an AUROC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.82, 0.98), which was not significantly lower than the AUROC for DN4, 0.92 (95% CI 0.85, 0.99, p\u2009=\u20090.56). Agreement between SCIPI and DN4 was of 0.88 (95% CI 0.77, 1.00). The French version of the SCIPI is a reliable and valid tool that can identify the presence of NeuP in an individual with SCI.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\".

Dermatillomania or skin picking disorder (SPD) is a chronic, recurrent, and treatment resistant neuropsychiatric disorder with an underestimated prevalence that has a concerning negative impact on an individual's health and quality of life. The current treatment strategies focus on behavioral and pharmacological therapies that are not very effective. Thus, the primary objective of this review is to provide an introduction to SPD and discuss its current treatment strategies as well as to propose biomaterial-based physical barrier strategies as a supporting or alternative treatment. To this end, searches were conducted within the PubMed database and Google Scholar, and the results obtained were organized and presented as per the following categories: prevalence, etiology, consequences, diagnostic criteria, and treatment strategies. Furthermore, special attention was provided to alternative treatment strategies and biomaterial-based physical treatment strategies. A total of six products with the potential to be applied as physical barrier strategies in supporting SPD treatment were shortlisted and discussed. The results indicated that SPD is a complex, underestimated, and underemphasized neuropsychiatric disorder that needs heightened attention, especially with regard to its treatment and care. Moreover, the high synergistic potential of biomaterials and nanosystems in this area remains to be explored. Certain strategies that are already being utilized for wound healing can also be further exploited, particularly as far as the prevention of infections is concerned.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Dermatillomania or skin picking disorder (SPD) is a chronic, recurrent, and treatment resistant neuropsychiatric disorder with an underestimated prevalence that has a concerning negative impact on an individual's health and quality of life. \"]}"}]}

Anemia is a frequent complication during the later stages of chronic kidney disease. When present, it may cause symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath. The pathogenesis of anemia in chronic kidney disease is complex, but a central feature is a relative deficit of erythropoietin. New information has elucidated the critical role of the hypoxia-sensing system in mediating erythropoietin synthesis and release. Iron deficiency is a second important factor in the anemia of chronic kidney disease. New insights into the dynamics of iron metabolism have clarified the role of chronic inflammation and hepcidin as key mediators of impaired iron utilization.

Extensive research on infant mortality (IM) exists in developing countries; however, most of the methods applied thus far relied on conventional regression analyses with limited prediction capability. Advanced of Machine Learning (AML) methods provide accurate prediction of IM; however, there is no study conducted using ML methods in Rwanda. This study, therefore, applied Machine Learning Methods for predicting infant mortality in Rwanda.\u00a0 METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was conducted using the 2014-15 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey. Python software version 3.8 was employed to test and apply ML methods through Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic regression. STATA version 13 was used for analysing conventional methods. Evaluation metrics methods specifically confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Area under the\u00a0Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) were used to evaluate the performance of predictive models. Ability of prediction was between 68.6% and 61.5% for AML. We preferred with the RF model (61.5%) presenting the best performance. The RF model was the best predictive model of IM with accuracy (84.3%), recall (91.3%), precision (80.3%), F1 score (85.5%), and AUROC (84.2%); followed by decision tree model with model accuracy (83%), recall (91%), precision (79%), F1 score (84.67%) and AUROC(82.9%), followed by support vector machine with model accuracy (68.6%), recall (74.9%), precision(67%), F1 score (70.73%) and AUROC (68.6%) and last was a logistic regression with the low accuracy of prediction (61.5%), recall (61.1%), precision (62.2%), F1 score (61.6%) and AUROC (61.5%) compared to other predictive models. Our predictive models showed that marital status, children ever born, birth order and wealth index are the 4 top predictors of IM.

IMiDs bind to CRBN and recruit neo-substrates for their ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation, which significantly expands the application of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) for targeted drug discovery. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which CRBN mediates the teratogenicity and anti-myeloma effect of IMiDs have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, the normal physiological functions of endogenous CRBN have not been extensively studied, which prevents the thorough assessment of side effects of the CRBN ligand-based PROTACs in the treatment of cancer and neurological diseases. To advance our understanding of the diverse functions of CRBN, in this review, we will survey the ubiquitination-dependent and -independent functions of CRBN, summarize recent advances in the discovery of constitutive substrates and neo-substrates of CRBN, and explore the molecular functions of CRBN in cancer treatment and in the development of neurological diseases.

The thymus is critical for central tolerance and diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire development, to provide lifelong defense against pathogens while maintaining self-tolerance. Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Small fibre neuropathy (SFN), a condition dominated by neuropathic pain, is frequently encountered in clinical practise either as prevalent manifestation of more diffuse neuropathy or distinct nosologic entity. Aetiology of SFN includes pre-diabetes status and immune-mediated diseases, though it remains frequently unknown. Due to their physiologic characteristics, small nerve fibres cannot be investigated by routine electrophysiological tests, making the diagnosis particularly difficult. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) to assess the psychophysical thresholds for cold and warm sensations and skin biopsy with quantification of somatic intraepidermal nerve fibres (IENF) have been used to determine the damage to small nerve fibres. Nevertheless, the diagnostic criteria for SFN have not been defined yet and a 'gold standard' for clinical practise and research is not available. We screened 486 patients referred to our institutions and collected 124 patients with sensory neuropathy. Among them, we identified 67 patients with pure SFN using a new diagnostic 'gold standard', based on the presence of at least two abnormal results at clinical, QST and skin biopsy examination. The diagnosis of SFN was achieved by abnormal clinical and skin biopsy findings in 43.3% of patients, abnormal skin biopsy and QST findings in 37.3% of patients, abnormal clinical and QST findings in 11.9% of patients, whereas 7.5% patients had abnormal results at all the examinations. Skin biopsy showed a diagnostic efficiency of 88.4%, clinical examination of 54.6% and QST of 46.9%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis confirmed the significantly higher performance of skin biopsy comparing with QST. However, we found a significant inverse correlation between IENF density and both cold and warm thresholds at the leg. Clinical examination revealed pinprick and thermal hypoesthesia in about 50% patients, and signs of peripheral vascular autonomic dysfunction in about 70% of patients. Spontaneous pain dominated the clinical picture in most SFN patients. Neuropathic pain intensity was more severe in patients with SFN than in patients with large or mixed fibre neuropathy, but there was no significant correlation with IENF density. The aetiology of SFN was initially unknown in 41.8% of patients and at 2-year follow-up a potential cause could be determined in 25% of them. Over the same period, 13% of SFN patients showed the involvement of large nerve fibres, whereas in 45.6% of them the clinical picture did not change. Spontaneous remission of neuropathic pain occurred in 10.9% of SFN patients, while it worsened in 30.4% of them.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Small fibre neuropathy (SFN), a condition dominated by neuropathic pain, is frequently encountered in clinical practise either as prevalent manifestation of more diffuse neuropathy or distinct nosologic entity.\"]}"}]}

This study used supervised machine learning-based predictive modeling to identify predictors of long-term ABR during prophylaxis with an extended half-life FVIII. \u2003Data were from 166 SHA patients who received N8-GP prophylaxis (50\u2009IU/kg every 4 days) in the pathfinder 2 study. Predictive models were developed to identify variables associated with an ABR of \u22641 versus >1 during the trial's main phase (median follow-up of 469 days). Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). Pre-N8-GP prophylaxis models learned from data collected at baseline; post-N8-GP prophylaxis models learned from data collected up to 12-weeks postswitch to N8-GP, and predicted ABR at the end of the outcome period (final year of treatment in the main phase). \u2003The predictive model using baseline variables had moderate performance (AUROC\u2009=\u20090.64) for predicting observed ABR.

Univariate cumulative bleed count at 12 weeks performed equally well to the 12-weeks postswitch model (AUROC\u2009=\u20090.75). Pharmacokinetic measures were indicative, but not essential, to predict ABR. \u2003Cumulative bleed count up to 12-weeks postswitch was as informative as the 12-week post-switch predictive model for predicting long-term ABR, supporting alterations in prophylaxis based on treatment response.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"ys).

Developmental prosopagnosia (DP) is a condition characterised by lifelong face recognition difficulties. Recent neuroimaging findings suggest that DP may be associated with aberrant structure and function in multimodal regions of cortex implicated in the processing of both facial and vocal identity. These findings suggest that both facial and vocal recognition may be impaired in DP. To test this possibility, we compared the performance of 22 DPs and a group of typical controls, on closely matched tasks that assessed famous face and famous voice recognition ability. As expected, the DPs showed severe impairment on the face recognition task, relative to typical controls. In contrast, however, the DPs and controls identified a similar number of voices. Despite evidence of interactions between facial and vocal processing, these findings suggest some degree of dissociation between the two processing pathways, whereby one can be impaired while the other develops typically. A possible explanation for this dissociation in DP could be that the deficit originates in the early perceptual encoding of face structure, rather than at later, post-perceptual stages of face identity processing, which may be more likely to involve interactions with other modalities.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Developmental prosopagnosia (DP) is a condition characterised by lifelong face recognition difficulties.\"]}"}]}

Efficacy and safety were assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of mitapivat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03559699, and is complete. Between June 26, 2018, and Feb 4, 2020, 27 participants (20 [74%] female and seven [26%] male; 20 [74%] White, three [11%] Asian, and four [15%] not reported) were enrolled and received at least one dose of mitapivat. Median duration of exposure to mitapivat was 40\u00b73 weeks (IQR 40\u00b70-41\u00b73). A reduction in transfusion burden by at least 33% was found in ten (37%) participants (95% CI 19-58; p=0\u00b70002). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were increase in alanine aminotransferase (ten [37%] participants), headache (ten [37%]), increase in aspartate aminotransferase (five [19%]), fatigue (five [19%]), and nausea (five [19%]). Two grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events were related to study treatment: joint swelling (one participant [4%]) and an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (one participant [4%]). Three participants had serious treatment-emergent adverse events, none related to the study treatment: increased blood triglycerides, ovarian cyst, and renal colic (each in one participant [4%]). No treatment-related deaths were observed. Mitapivat represents a novel therapy that can reduce transfusion burden in some adults with pyruvate kinase deficiency receiving regular transfusions, and is the first disease-modifying agent approved in this disease.

However, it is clear that non-IgE-mediated pathways can induce symptoms indistinguishable from those of classic anaphylaxis, and their activation could explain the severity of IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. Indeed, mast cells and basophils can be activated by antibodies against IgE or their receptors, by molecules such as anaphylatoxins, or through G-coupled receptors. Some other allergens can induce antibodies of class IgG that can activate neutrophils to produce a molecule similar to histamine to induce anaphylaxis. Finally, some inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin or prostaglandin can also modulate mast cell and basophil activation as well as directly cause vasodilation and bronchoconstriction, resulting in anaphylaxis-like reactions.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Anaphylaxis is a rapidly evolving, acute, life-threatening reaction that occurs rapidly on contact with a trigger.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds.

Assessing prognosis for acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure (APAP-ALF) patients often presents significant challenges. King's College (KCC) has been validated on hospital admission, but little has been published on later phases of illness. We aimed to improve determinations of prognosis both at the time of and following admission for APAP-ALF using Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models. CART models were applied to US ALFSG registry data to predict 21-day death or liver transplant early (on admission) and post-admission (days 3-7) for 803 APAP-ALF patients enrolled 01/1998-09/2013. Accuracy in prediction of outcome (AC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), and area under receiver-operating curve (AUROC) were compared between 3 models: KCC (INR, creatinine, coma grade, pH), CART analysis using only KCC variables (KCC-CART) and a CART model using new variables (NEW-CART). Traditional KCC yielded 69% AC, 90% SP, 27% SN, and 0.58 AUROC on admission, with similar performance post-admission. KCC-CART at admission offered predictive 66% AC, 65% SP, 67% SN, and 0.74 AUROC. Post-admission, KCC-CART had predictive 82% AC, 86% SP, 46% SN and 0.81 AUROC. NEW-CART models using MELD (Model for end stage liver disease), lactate and mechanical ventilation on admission yielded predictive 72% AC, 71% SP, 77% SN and AUROC 0.79. For later stages, NEW-CART (MELD, lactate, coma grade) offered predictive AC 86%, SP 91%, SN 46%, AUROC 0.73. CARTs offer simple prognostic models for APAP-ALF patients, which have higher AUROC and SN than KCC, with similar AC and negligibly worse SP.

Disease prevalence is rarely explicitly considered in the early stages of the development of novel prognostic tests. Rather, researchers use the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) as the key metric to gauge and report predictive performance ability. Because this statistic does not account for disease prevalence, proposed tests may not appropriately address clinical requirements. This ultimately impedes the translation of prognostic tests into clinical practice. A method to express positive- and/or negative predictive value criteria (PPV, NPV) within the ROC space is presented. Equations are derived for so-called equi-PPV (and equi-NPV) lines. Herewith it is possible, for any given prevalence, to plot a series of sensitivity-specificity pairs which meet a specified PPV (or NPV) criterion onto the ROC space.This concept is introduced by firstly reviewing the well-established \"mechanics\", strengths and limitations of the ROC analysis in the context of developing prognostic models. Then, the use of PPV (and/or) NPV criteria to augment the ROC analysis is elaborated.Additionally, an interactive web tool was also created to enable people to explore the dynamics of lines of equi-predictive value in function of prevalence. The web tool also allows to gauge what ROC curve shapes best meet specific positive and/or negative predictive value criteria (http://d4ta.link/ppvnpv/). To illustrate the merits and implications of this concept, an example on the prediction of pre-eclampsia risk in low-risk nulliparous pregnancies is elaborated. In risk stratification, the clinical usefulness of a prognostic test can be expressed in positive- and negative predictive value criteria; the development of novel prognostic tests will be facilitated by the possibility to co-visualise such criteria together with ROC curves.\u00a0To achieve clinically meaningful risk stratification, the development of separate tests to meet either a pre-specified positive value (rule-in) or a negative predictive value (rule-out) criteria should be considered: the characteristics of successful rule-in and rule-out tests may markedly differ.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"stic tests.

All patients receiving pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab or durvalumab between September 2016 and September 2019 at Haga Teaching Hospital, The Hague, The Netherlands were included in this retrospective study. Immune-related adverse drug reactions (irADRs) were manually retrieved from the electronic patient files. The cumulative incidence of irADRs were compared between younger (<65\u00a0years) and older (\u226565\u00a0years) patients using a Pearsons Chi-square test. We identified 217 patients who were treated with at least one dose of PD-(L)1 inhibitor. 58% were 65\u00a0years or older at the start of immunotherapy. 183 patients (84.3%) received monotherapy PD-(L)1 inhibitors and 34 (15.7%) received chemo-immunotherapy. A total of 278 irADRs were registered. Cutaneous irADRs (53.9%), thyroid gland disorders (20.3%), and non-infectious diarrhoea/colitis (17.5%) were the most frequently reported irADRs. The majority of the irADRs were mild to moderate and no fatal irADRs were observed. 61 (21.9%) of the irADRs needed systemic treatment, of which 19 (6.8%) required treatment with corticosteroids. 18 irADRs (6.5%) were severe and resulted in hospitalisation. The cumulative incidence of cutaneous irADRs was different between the age groups: 45.7% of the patients <65\u00a0years and in 60.0% of the patients \u226565\u00a0years (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036).

This review summarizes recent advances in the molecular classification of adult gliomas. According to the 2016 WHO classification, five main molecular subgroups of adult diffuse gliomas can be distinguished based on the 1p/19q codeletion, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and histone H3.3 mutation status. In the future, this classification may be further refined based on the integration of additional biomarkers, in particular CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion in IDH-mutant astrocytomas, TERT promoter mutations, EGFR amplification, chromosome 7 gain and chromosome 10 loss in IDH-wildtype astrocytomas, and FGFR1 mutations in midline gliomas. Histone H3.3 G34R/V defines a distinct subgroup of hemispheric IDH-wildtype high-grade gliomas occurring in young patients and FGFR gene fusions characterize a subgroup of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas that could benefit from specific treatment approaches. RNA sequencing may identify targetable gene fusions in circumscribed gliomas lacking classical BRAF alterations. In chordoid gliomas, recurrent PRKCA mutations could serve as a new diagnostic marker. Among comprehensive molecular analysis methods, DNA methylation profiling appears as a particularly powerful approach to identify new molecular subgroups of gliomas and to classify difficult cases. The classification of adult gliomas may be improved by the integration of additional biomarkers and/or by comprehensive molecular analysis, in particular DNA methylation profiling. The most relevant approach, however, remains to be established.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"O classification, five main molecular subgroups of adult diffuse gliomas can be distinguished based on the 1p/19q codeletion, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and histone H3.3 mutation status.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Many of the principal clinical manifestations involve organs where mast cell concentrations are highest: the skin, the lungs, and the gastrointestinal tract. Histamine and other deleterious inflammatory mediators promote vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction; they are readily released from sensitized mast cells and basophils challenged with antigen. Anaphylaxis may be triggered by a variety of antigens including insect and reptile venom, a variety of drugs, vaccines, and food. Anaphylaxis is a clinical diagnosis made from a collection of signs and symptoms. It is most commonly based on pattern recognition. Differential diagnoses include severe asthma, pheocromocytoma, and mastocytosis. Epinephrine is considered the drug of choice for the treatment of anaphylaxis. It acts primarily as a vasopressor in improving hemodynamic recovery. Adjunctive treatments include fluid therapy, H1 and H2 antihistamines, corticosteroids, and bronchodilators; however, these do not substitute for epinephrine. Prognosis depends on the severity of the clinical signs. The clinical signs will vary among species and route of exposure.

The prevalence of iron deficiency and its contribution to the anemia of end stage renal disease has been extensively studied, but much less is known about the role of iron deficiency in the pathogenesis of the anemia of chronic kidney disease in predialysis patients. All new hemodialysis patients entering a single hemodialysis unit between July 1999 and April 2002 were included in the study. The admission laboratory tests and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) 2728 form were examined to determine the prevalence of erythropoietin use, anemia (Hb<11 g/dl), and iron deficiency (ferritin<100 ng/ml and transferrin saturation %<20%). In a second part of the study, the effect of intravenous iron gluconate replacement in patients with stage III & IV chronic kidney disease was examined. Anemia was present in 68% of all patients starting hemodialysis. Iron deficiency was a common feature occurring in 29% of patients taking erythropoietin (49% of all patients) and 26% of patients without erythropoietin (51% of all patients). Following the administration of intravenous iron gluconate to four patients, there was a significant rise in hemoglobin levels from 10.6+/-0.19 to 11.7+/-g/dl (p=0.02).

Anemia is common and associated with adverse outcomes in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Many factors contribute to declining hemoglobin as CKD progresses, but impaired production of erythropoietin by failing kidneys is a central cause. Hepcidin-mediated iron restriction also contributes to anemia by downregulating both intestinal iron absorption and release of stored iron for erythropoiesis. The core components of anemia management remain erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) and iron supplementation, but despite these therapies, a substantial number of children remain anemic. Although escalating ESA dose to target higher hemoglobin has been associated with adverse outcomes in adults, no trials have investigated this association in children, and maintaining hemoglobin levels in a narrow range with conservative ESA dosing is challenging. Judicious use of iron supplementation can enhance the response to ESAs, but the iron storage markers most commonly used in clinical practice have limitations in distinguishing which patients will benefit most from additional iron. Several novel anemia therapies, including hypoxia-inducible factor stabilizers, prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, and dialysate-delivered iron supplements, have been developed and may offer options for alternative anemia management. However, the safety and efficacy of these agents in children with CKD has yet to be assessed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"nemia in chronic kidney disease\", \"nemia is common and associated with adverse outcomes in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD\"]}"}]}

Anemia is a common complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and is associated with a reduced quality of life, and an increased morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms involved in anemia associated to CKD are diverse and complex. They include a decrease in endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) production, absolute and/or functional iron deficiency, and inflammation with increased hepcidin levels, among others. Patients are most commonly managed with oral or intravenous iron supplements and with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA). However, these treatments have associated risks, and sometimes are insufficiently effective. Nonetheless, in the last years, there have been some remarkable advances in the treatment of CKD-related anemia, which have raised great expectations. On the one hand, a novel family of drugs has been developed: the hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs). These agents induce, among other effects, an increase in the production of endogenous EPO, improve iron availability and reduce hepcidin levels. Some of them have already received marketing authorization. On the other hand, recent clinical trials have elucidated important aspects of iron supplementation, which may change the treatment targets in the future. This article reviews the current knowledge of the pathophysiology CKD-related anemia, current and future therapies, the trends in patient management and the unmet goals.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"nemia in Chronic Kidney Disease: \", \"nemia is a common complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and is associated with a reduced quality of life,\"]}"}]}

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Predictive modeling with electronic health record (EHR) data is anticipated to drive personalized medicine and improve healthcare quality. Constructing predictive statistical models typically requires extraction of curated predictor variables from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive process that discards the vast majority of information in each patient's record. We propose a representation of patients' entire raw EHR records based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. We demonstrate that deep learning methods using this representation are capable of accurately predicting multiple medical events from multiple centers without site-specific data harmonization. We validated our approach using de-identified EHR data from two US academic medical centers with 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at least 24\u2009h. In the sequential format we propose, this volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945 data points, including clinical notes. Deep learning models achieved high accuracy for tasks such as predicting: in-hospital mortality (area under the receiver operator curve [AUROC] across sites 0.93-0.94), 30-day unplanned readmission (AUROC 0.75-0.76), prolonged length of stay (AUROC 0.85-0.86), and all of a patient's final discharge diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90). These models outperformed traditional, clinically-used predictive models in all cases.

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms.

Here we report that glutamine synthetase (GS) is an endogenous substrate of CRL4(CRBN). Upon exposing cells to high glutamine concentration, GS is acetylated at lysines 11 and 14, yielding a degron that is necessary and sufficient for binding and ubiquitylation by CRL4(CRBN) and degradation by the proteasome. Binding of acetylated degron peptides to CRBN depends on an intact thalidomide-binding pocket but is not competitive with IMiDs.

Anaphylaxis is the most severe form of allergic reaction, resulting from the effect of mediators and chemotactic substances released by activated cells. Mast cells and basophils are considered key players in IgE-mediated human anaphylaxis. Beyond IgE-mediated activation of mast cells/basophils, further mechanisms are involved in the occurrence of anaphylaxis. New insights into the potential relevance of pathways other than mast cell and basophil degranulation have been unraveled, such as the activation of the contact and the coagulation systems. Mast cell heparin released upon activation provides negatively charged surfaces for factor XII (FXII) binding and auto-activation. Activated FXII, the initiating serine protease in both the contact and the intrinsic coagulation system, activates factor XI and prekallikrein, respectively. FXII-mediated bradykinin (BK) formation has been proven in the human plasma of anaphylactic patients as well as in experimental models of anaphylaxis. Moreover, the severity of anaphylaxis is correlated with the increase in plasma heparin, BK formation and the intensity of contact system activation. FXII also activates plasminogen in the fibrinolysis system. Mast cell tryptase has been shown to participate in fibrinolysis through plasmin activation and by facilitating the degradation of fibrinogen.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Iron is vital for a vast variety of cellular processes and its homeostasis is strictly controlled and regulated. Nevertheless, disorders of iron metabolism are diverse and can be caused by insufficiency, overload or iron mal-distribution in tissues. Iron deficiency (ID) progresses to iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) after iron stores are depleted. Inflammation is of diverse etiology in anemia of chronic disease (ACD). It results in serum hypoferremia and tissue hyperferritinemia, which are caused by elevated serum hepcidin levels, and this underlies the onset of functional iron-deficiency anemia. Inflammation is also inhibitory to erythropoietin function and may directly increase hepcidin level, which influences iron metabolism. Consequently, immune responses orchestrate iron metabolism, aggravate iron sequestration and, ultimately, impair the processes of erythropoiesis. Hence, functional iron-deficiency anemia is a risk factor for several ailments, disorders and diseases. Therefore, therapeutic strategies depend on the symptoms, severity, comorbidities and the associated risk factors of anemia. Oral iron supplements can be employed to treat ID and mild anemia particularly, when gastrointestinal intolerance is minimal. Intravenous (IV) iron is the option in moderate and severe anemic conditions, for patients with compromised intestinal integrity, or when oral iron is refractory. Erythropoietin (EPO) is used to treat functional iron deficiency, and blood transfusion is restricted to refractory patients or in life-threatening emergency situations. Despite these interventions, many patients remain anemic and do not respond to conventional treatment approaches. However, various novel therapies are being developed to treat persistent anemia in patients.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"nemia of Inflammation with An Emphasis on Chronic Kidney Disease\"]}"}]}

Engineered T cells have achieved success in the treatment of blood cancers, with four chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies now approved for the treatment of B cell malignancies based on their unprecedented efficacy in clinical trials. However, similar results have not yet been achieved in the treatment of the much larger patient population with solid tumours. For cell therapies to become mainstream medicines, they may need to offer transformational clinical effects for patients and be applicable in disease settings that remain unaddressed by simpler approaches.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57).

Functional variability among boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is well recognised and complicates interpretation of clinical studies. We hypothesised that boys with DMD could be clustered into groups sharing similar trajectories of ambulatory function over time, as measured by the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score. We also explored associations with other variables such as age, functional abilities, and genotype. Using the NorthStar Clinical Network database, 395 patients with >1 NSAA assessment were identified. We utilised latent class trajectory analysis of longitudinal NSAA scores, which produced evidence for at least four clusters of boys sharing similar trajectories versus age in decreasing order of clinical severity: 25% of the boys were in cluster 1 (NSAA falling to \u2264 5 at age ~10y), 35% were in cluster 2 (NSAA \u2264 5 ~12y), 21% in were cluster 3 (NSAA\u2264 5 ~14y), and 19% in cluster 4 (NSAA > 5 up to 15y). Mean ages at diagnosis of DMD were similar across clusters (4.2, 3.9, 4.3, and 4.8y, respectively). However, at the first NSAA assessment, a significant (p<0.05) association was observed between earlier declining clusters and younger age, worse NSAA, slower rise from supine, slower 10 metre walk/run times, and younger age of steroid initiation. In order to assess the probability of observing complete loss of function for individual NSAA items, we examined the proportion of patients who shifted from a score of 1 or 2 at baseline to a score of 0.

With the discovery of the protein degradation mechanism of IMiDs, targeted protein degradation mediated by IMiDs via CRBN emerged and developed rapidly for the advantages of overcoming drug resistance and targeting undruggable. To date, almost all CRBN ligands are derived from thalidomide and there are few structural differences between them. Hence, we employed an accurate, effective, and rational approach to screen novel and potential CRBN ligands. In this study, we have built a molecular library by scaffold hopping with thalidomide. ADMET screening, virtual screening, and visual inspection screening\u00a0were performed step-by-step to screen the molecular library and five molecules were hit. Furthermore, docking analysis and a period of 150\u2009ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulation were performed to validate the accuracy of our screen. The docking results showed that molecular A (-10.42\u2009kcal/mol), molecular B (-9.73\u2009kcal/mol), molecular C (-9.25\u2009kcal/mol), molecular D (-9.09\u2009kcal/mol), and molecular E (-10.16\u2009kcal/mol) have lower binding energy than thalidomide (-5.42\u2009kcal/mol), lenalidomide (-5.74\u2009kcal/mol), and pomalidomide (-5.51\u2009kcal/mol). In the MD simulation, all the five screened molecules form key interactions with the active site amino acid residues (Trp380, Trp386, and Trp400) as well as the three marketed IMiDs. Besides, we found and explained that Pro352 was positive for ligand binding to CRBN and Glu377 in reverse, which has not been reported before. We believe that our findings and those five molecules can serve as further optimization of CRBN ligands and development of proteolysis targeting chimeras.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Thalidomide and its derivatives lenalidomide and\\u00c2\\u00a0pomalidomide, known as immunomodulatory drugs, (IMiDs)\\u00c2\\u00a0bind\\u00c2\\u00a0directly to cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in the rapid ubiquitination and degradation of the substrate protein.\"]}"}]}

The North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) tool is a key instrument for measuring clinical outcomes in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). To gain a better understanding of the longitudinal utility of the NSAA, we evaluated NSAA data from a phase II trial of 120 patients with DMD treated with domagrozumab or placebo. The NSAA exploratory analyses included assessment of individual skills gained/lost, total skills gained/lost, cumulative loss of function, and the impact of transient loss of function due to a temporary disability on NSAA total score (temporary zero score). There was no significant difference in the total number of NSAA skills gained (mean 1.41 and 1.04, respectively; p = 0.3314) or lost (3.90 vs. 5.0; p = 0.0998) between domagrozumab- vs. placebo-treated patients at week 49.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Preclinical studies showed that glofitamab leads to T-cell activation, proliferation, and tumor cell killing upon binding to CD20 on malignant cells. Here, we provide evidence of glofitamab's clinical activity, including pharmacodynamic profile, mode of action, and factors associated with clinical response, by evaluating biomarkers in patient samples from the dose-escalation part of this trial. Patients enrolled in Study NP30179 received single-dose obinutuzumab pretreatment (1000 mg) 7\u00a0days before IV glofitamab (5 \u00b5g-25 mg). Glofitamab treatment lasted \u226412 cycles once every 2 or 3 weeks. Blood samples were collected at predefined time points per the clinical protocol; T-cell populations were evaluated centrally by flow cytometry, and cytokine profiles were analyzed. Immunohistochemical and genomic biomarker analyses were performed on tumor biopsy samples. Pharmacodynamic modulation was observed with glofitamab treatment, including dose-dependent induction of cytokines, and T-cell margination, proliferation, and activation in peripheral blood. Gene expression analysis of pretreatment tumor biopsy samples indicated that tumor cell intrinsic factors such as TP53 signaling are associated with resistance to glofitamab, but they may also be interlinked with a diminished effector T-cell profile in resistant tumors and thus represent a poor prognostic factor per se. This integrative biomarker data analysis provides clinical evidence regarding glofitamab's mode of action, supports optimal biological dose selection, and will further guide clinical development.

Cereblon (CRBN), originally identified as a gene associated with intellectual disability, was identified as primary target of thalidomide. Accumulating evidence has shown that CRBN is a substrate receptor of Cullin Ring E3 ubiquitin ligase 4 (CRL4) containing DDB1, CUL4, and RBX1, which recognizes specific neosubstrates in the presence of thalidomide or its analogs and induces their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. A set of small-molecule, CRBN-binding drugs are known as molecular glue degraders because these compounds promote the interaction between CRBN and its neosubstrates.

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Sunlight is attenuated rapidly in the ocean, resulting in little visually useful light reaching deeper than approximately 1000 m in even the clearest water. To maximize sensitivity to the relatively brighter downwelling sunlight, to view the silhouette of animals above them, and to increase the binocular overlap of their eyes, many mesopelagic animals have developed upward-pointing tubular eyes. However, these sacrifice the ability to detect bioluminescent and reflective objects in other directions. Thus, some mesopelagic fish with tubular eyes extend their visual fields laterally and/or ventrally by lensless ocular diverticula, which are thought to provide unfocused images, allowing only simple detection of objects, with little spatial resolution. Here, we show that a medial mirror within the ventrally facing ocular diverticulum of the spookfish, Dolichopteryx longipes, consisting of a multilayer stack derived from a retinal tapetum, is used to reflect light onto a lateral retina. The reflective plates are not orientated parallel to the surface of the mirror. Instead, plate angles change progressively around the mirror, and computer modeling indicates that this provides a well-focused image. This is the first report of an ocular image being formed in a vertebrate eye by a mirror.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes.

This study was designed to compare biomechanical characteristics of the knee joint for several athletic tasks to elucidate their effects and to examine what tasks pose a risk for ACL injury. Three athletic tasks were performed by 24 female athletes: single-limb landing, plant and cutting, and both-limb jump landing. Angular displacements of flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and external/internal tibial rotation were calculated. Angular excursion and the rate of excursion of abduction and internal tibial rotation were also calculated. During plant and cutting, from foot contact, subjects rotated the tibia more rapidly and to a greater degree toward internal tibial rotation. Moreover, excursion of knee abduction is greater than that during single-limb landing. During both-limb jump landing, the knee flexion at foot contact was greater than for either single-limb landing or plant and cutting; peak knee abduction was greater than for either single-limb landing or plant and cutting. In plant and cutting, the risk of ACL injury is increased by greater excursion and more rapid knee abduction than that which occurs in single-limb landing, in addition to greater internal tibial rotation. Although single-limb tasks apparently pose a greater risk for ACL injury than bilateral landings, both-limb landing with greater knee abduction might also risk ACL injury.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Kinases have gained an important place in the list of vital therapeutic targets because of their overwhelming clinical success in the last two decades. Among various clinically validated kinases, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) are one of the extensively studied drug targets for clinical development. Food and Drug Administration has approved three CDK inhibitors for therapeutic use, and at least 27 inhibitors are under active clinical development. In the last decade, research and development in this area took a rapid pace, and thus the analysis of scaffold diversity is essential for future drug design. Available reviews lack the systematic study and discussion on the scaffold diversity of CDK inhibitors. Herein we have reviewed and critically analyzed the chemical diversity present in the preclinical and clinical pipeline of CDK inhibitors. Our analysis has shown that although several scaffolds represent CDK inhibitors, only the amino-pyrimidine is a well-represented scaffold. The three-nitrogen framework of amino-pyrimidine is a fundamental hinge-binding unit. Further, we have discussed the selectivity aspects among CDKs, the clinical trial dose-limiting toxicities, and highlighted the most advanced clinical candidates. We also discuss the changing paradigm towards selective inhibitors and an overview of ATP-binding pockets of all druggable CDKs. We carefully analyzed the clinical pipeline to unravel the candidates that are currently under active clinical development. In addition to the plenty of dual CDK4/6 inhibitors, there are many selective CDK7, CDK9, and CDK8/19 inhibitors in the clinical pipeline.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Among various clinically validated kinases, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) are one of the extensively studied drug targets for clinical developmen\"]}"}]}

Telemedicine applications are increasingly being introduced in patient care in various disciplines, including clinical genetics, mainly to increase access to care and to reduce time and costs for patients and professionals. Most telegenetics reports describe applications in large geographical areas, showing positive patients' and professionals' satisfaction. One economic analysis published thus far reported lower costs than in-person care. We hypothesized that telegenetics can also be beneficial from the professional's view in relatively small geographical areas. We performed a pilot study in the Northern Netherlands of 51 home-based online counseling sessions for cardiogenetic and oncogenetic cascade screening, and urgent prenatal counseling. Previously, we showed patient satisfaction, anxiety, and perceived control of online counseling to be comparable to in-person counseling. This study focuses on expectations, satisfaction, and practical evaluations of the involved counselors, and the impact in terms of time and costs. Most counselors expected disadvantages of online counseling for themselves and their patients, mainly concerning insufficient non-verbal communication; few expected advantages for themselves. Afterwards, counselors additionally raised the disadvantage of insufficient verbal communication, and reported frequent technical problems. Their overall mean telemedicine satisfaction itemscore was 3.38 before, and 2.95 afterwards, being afterwards slightly below the minimum level we set for a satisfactory result. We estimated reduced time and costs by online counseling with about 8% and 10-12%, respectively. We showed online genetic counseling to be effective, feasible and cost-efficient, but technical improvements are needed to increase counselors' satisfaction.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"We estimated reduced time and costs by online counseling with about 8% and 10-12%, respectively. \"]}"}]}

A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Necroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death mediated by the pseudokinase mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). Upon phosphorylation by receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3), MLKL oligomerizes, and translocates to and disrupts the plasma membrane, thereby causing necroptotic cell lysis. Herein, we show that activation of necroptosis in mouse dermal fibroblasts (MDFs) and HT-29 human colorectal cancer cells results in accumulation of the autophagic marker, lipidated LC3B (also known as MAP1LC3B), in an MLKL-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, the necroptosis-induced increase in lipidated LC3B was due to inhibition of autophagic flux, not the activation of autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy by MLKL correlated with a decrease in autophagosome and/or autolysosome function, and required the association of activated MLKL with intracellular membranes. Collectively, our findings uncover an additional role for the MLKL pseudokinase, namely to inhibit autophagy during necroptosis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"anslocates to and disrupts the plasma membrane, thereby causing necroptotic cell lysis.

Here, we evaluated beremagene geperpavec (B-VEC), an engineered, non-replicating COL7A1 containing herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) vector, to treat RDEB skin. B-VEC restored C7 expression in RDEB keratinocytes, fibroblasts, RDEB mice and human RDEB xenografts. Subsequently, a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 clinical trial (NCT03536143) evaluated matched wounds from nine RDEB patients receiving topical B-VEC or placebo repeatedly over 12\u2009weeks. No grade 2 or above B-VEC-related adverse events or vector shedding or tissue-bound skin immunoreactants were noted. HSV-1 and C7 antibodies sometimes presented at baseline or increased after B-VEC treatment without an apparent impact on safety or efficacy.

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds.

Multiple treatment strategies are under investigation and have shown promise for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Use of molecular-based therapies that replace or correct the missing or nonfunctional dystrophin protein has gained momentum. These strategies include gene replacement with adeno-associated virus, exon skipping with antisense oligonucleotides, and mutation suppression with compounds that \"read through\" stop codon mutations. Other strategies include cell therapy and surrogate gene products to compensate for the loss of dystrophin. All of these approaches are discussed in this review, with particular emphasis on the most recent advances made in each therapeutic discipline.

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The maximum number of germ cells is present during the fetal life in mammals. Follicular atresia results in rapid depletion of germ cells from the cohort of the ovary. At the time of puberty, only a few hundred (<1%) germ cells are either culminated into oocytes or further get eliminated during the reproductive life. Although apoptosis plays a major role, necrosis as well as necroptosis, might also be involved in germ cell elimination from the mammalian ovary. Both necrosis and necroptosis show similar morphological features and are characterized by an increase in cell volume, cell membrane permeabilization, and rupture that lead to cellular demise. Necroptosis is initiated by tumor necrosis factor and operated through receptor interacting protein kinase as well as mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein. The acetylcholinesterase, cytokines, starvation, and oxidative stress play important roles in necroptosis-mediated granulosa cell death. The granulosa cell necroptosis directly or indirectly induces susceptibility toward necroptotic or apoptotic cell death in oocytes. Indeed, prevention of necrosis and necroptosis pathways using their specific inhibitors could enhance growth/differentiation factor-9 expression, improve survivability as well as the meiotic competency of oocytes, and prevent decline of reproductive potential in several mammalian species and early onset of menopause in women. This study updates the information and focuses on the possible involvement of necrosis and necroptosis in germ cell depletion from the mammalian ovary.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Both necrosis and necroptosis show similar morphological features and are characterized by an increase in cell volume, cell membrane permeabilization, and rupture that lead to cellular demise.\"]}"}]}

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common muscular dystrophy in the pediatric population. The manifestations of this disease include progressive muscle weakness, gait dysfunction, and motor impairment, leading to a loss of ambulation by the age of 13\u2009years. Molecular diagnosis is the standard diagnostic tool for DMD. This study aimed to investigate disease progression and genetic patterns in Iranian ambulant boys and to find the correlation between genotypes and motor function phenotypes. This study was performed on 152 DMD patients. Clinical history, including the disease phenotype, steroid therapy, and the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) score, was taken for all the patients. Molecular diagnoses were confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and next-generation sequencing tests. A total of 152 Iranian DMD patients were examined in this study. The mean age at the time of disease onset was 4.04\u2009\u00b1\u20092.00\u2009years, and the mean age at diagnosis was 5.05\u2009\u00b1\u20092.08\u2009years. The mean age of ambulation loss was 10.9\u2009years. Contracture was reported in 38.9% of cases. In terms of age, the mean total NSAA score showed a peak at 4 years of age, with a mean NSAA score of 24. Annual changes in the NSAA score were determined for all cases, based on the mutation type and exon site. Deletion mutation was found in 79.1% of cases, duplication in 6.8%, nonsense in 12.8%, and splice site in 1.4%. The most common single exon deletion was exon 44 (5.3%), and the most common multiexon deletions were attributed to exons 45-50 and exons 45-52 (4.6%). The results did not indicate any correlation between the mutation type and age at the time of disease onset, loss of ambulation age, and wheelchair dependence; however, a significant association was found between contracture and mutation type. The results showed a significant difference in the NSAA score between the deletion and nonsense groups at the age of 3 years (P\u2009=\u20090.04). No significant correlation was found between the phenotype and exon site. Overall, 91.1% of the study population had a history of corticosteroid use, and 54.1% showed compliance with rehabilitation therapy. This study demonstrated the phenotypes and mutational features of Iranian DMD boys and provided information regarding the natural motor history of the disease, disease progression, diagnosis, and status of DMD management in Iran. The present findings can promote the development of clinical trials and future advanced molecular therapies in Iran.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The results showed a significant difference in the NSAA score between the deletion and nonsense groups at the age of 3 years (P\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2030=\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u20300.04).\"]}"}]}

Dysregulation of alternative splicing (AS) induced by serine/arginine-rich proteins has recently been linked to cancer metastasis. Nonetheless, as a member of the serine/arginine-rich protein family, the involvement of SRSF11 in colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. The TCGA dataset and clinical samples were used to assess SRSF11 expression levels in CRC. For SRSF11, functional experiments were conducted both in vitro and in vivo. RNA-seq technology was used to analyze and screen SRSF11-triggered AS events, which were then confirmed by in vivo UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and mini-gene reporter assays. Jalview software was used to determine the preferential binding motif with relation to exon skipping (ES) events. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and Phospho-tag SDS-PAGE experiments were used to investigate PAK5-mediated phosphorylation regulation on SRSF11, and in vitro kinase experiments validated the interaction. In CRC, SRSF11 was discovered to be overexpressed and associated with a poor prognosis. And SRSF11 played a pro-metastatic role in vitro and in vivo. By screening SRSF11-regulated AS events, we identified the binding motif of SRSF11-triggered splicing-switching of HSPA12A AS, which specifically regulated HSPA12A AS by directly binding to a motif in exon 2. Mechanistically, the HSPA12A transcript with exon 2 retention increased N-cadherin expression by promoting RNA stability. Furthermore, the oncogenic kinase PAK5 phosphorylated SRSF11 at serine 287, protecting it from ubiquitination degradation. SRSF11 exerts pro-metastatic effects in CRC by inhibiting the AS of HSPA12A pre-RNA. Our findings point to SRSF11-regulated HSPA12A splicing as a novel relationship between SRSF11-regulated splicing and CRC metastasis and suggest a PAK5/SRSF11/HSPA12A axis as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in CRC.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Alternative splicing of HSPA12A pre-RNA by SRSF11 contributes to metastasis potential of colorectal cancer.\"]}"}]}

Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent a new direction in small-molecule therapeutics whereby a heterobifunctional linker to a protein of interest (POI) induces its ubiquitination-based proteolysis by recruiting an E3 ligase. Here, we show that charge reduction, native mass spectrometry, and gas-phase activation methods combine for an in-depth analysis of a PROTAC-linked ternary complex. Electron capture dissociation (ECD) of the intact POI-PROTAC-VCB complex (a trimeric subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase) promotes POI dissociation.

In addition, we used ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and collisional activation to identify the source of this unexpected dissociation. Together, the evidence shows that this integrated approach can be used to screen for ternary complex formation and PROTAC-protein contacts and may report on PROTAC-induced protein-protein interactions, a characteristic correlated with PROTAC selectivity and efficacy.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent a new direction in small-molecule therapeutics whereby a heterobifunctional linker to a protein of interest (POI) induces its ubiquitination-based proteolysis by recruiting an E3 ligase.\"]}"}]}

Superior mesenteric artery syndrome, or Wilkie's syndrome, is an unexpected cause of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. The exact incidence of the condition remains unknown, and limited case reports are present in the literature. The obstruction results in the compression of the third part of the duodenum between the superior mesenteric artery and aorta. It is widely known that a lack of subcutaneous tissue in the area can precipitate the obstruction by significantly reducing the aortomesenteric angle. Wilkie's syndrome presents a clinically diagnostic challenge as patients initially remain undiagnosed with relapsing episodes of upper abdominal pain and bilious vomiting. In some cases, an acute obstruction may arise. Undertaking an initial contrast study of the upper gastrointestinal tract and a CT scan are required to confirm the diagnosis of the condition. In the present study, we elucidate the case of a 12-year-old girl who presented with upper abdominal pain and bouts of bilious vomiting. Upon extensive diagnostic evaluation, Wilkie's syndrome was diagnosed. Since the patient failed to respond to conservative treatment, a laparotomy with subsequent duodenojejunostomy was undertaken.

Through the binding of antisense oligoribonucleotides to exon-internal sequences in the pre-mRNA, the splicing can be manipulated in such a manner that the targeted exon is skipped and a slightly shorter, but in-frame, transcript is generated. We recently showed that antisense oligoribonucleotide-mediated skipping of exon 46 efficiently induced dystrophin synthesis in cultured muscle cells from Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients carrying an exon 45 deletion. In this study we have identified antisense oligoribonucleotides with which the skipping of 11 other Duchenne muscular dystrophy exons could be induced in cultured human muscle cells. The targeted skipping of only one particular exon may restore the reading frame in a series of patients with different mutations.

This review focuses on several aspects of SFN including etiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria and tests, management, and future perspectives. Diagnostic challenges are discussed, encompassing the role of accurate and standardized assessment of symptoms and signs and providing clues for the clinical practice. The authors discuss the evidence in support of skin biopsy and quantitative sensory testing as diagnostic tests and present an overview of other diagnostic techniques to assess sensory and autonomic fibers dysfunction. The authors also suggest a systematic approach to the etiology including a set of laboratory tests and genetic examinations of sodium channelopathies and other rare conditions that might drive the therapeutic approach based on underlying cause or symptoms treatment.

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds.

Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. Use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) has been a mainstay of treatment since 1990. A series of large trials demonstrated that ESAs have serious safety problems, including increasing cardiovascular and thrombotic events, and death. Analyses suggest high pharmacologic doses of ESAs, rather than the highly achieved hemoglobin, may mediate harm. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activators stimulate endogenous erythropoietin production and enhance iron availability. In early clinical trials, these oral agents appear to be capable of replacing ESA therapy and minimizing the need for i.v. iron therapy for chronic kidney disease-related anemia, while having other potentially advantageous actions. Large phase 3 trials are underway with several HIF activators. This commentary reviews trends in anemia management, the safety issues related to our present therapies, the role of HIF in regulating erythropoiesis, and the diverse actions of HIF activators.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"options for the anemia of chronic kidney disease.\", \"nemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease\"]}"}]}

Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), with its cyclin T regulatory subunit, is a component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, which stimulates transcription elongation and also functions in co-transcriptional histone modification, mRNA processing, and mRNA export. CDK9 also binds to cyclin K but the function of this CDK9-cyclin K complex is less clear. We and others have recently shown that CDK9 functions directly in maintaining genome integrity. This activity is restricted to CDK9-cyclin K. Depletion of CDK9 or its cyclin K but not cyclin T regulatory subunit impairs cell cycle recovery in response to replication stress and induces spontaneous DNA damage in replicating cells. CDK9-cyclin K also interacts with ATR and other DNA damage response and DNA repair proteins. CDK9 accumulates on chromatin and limits the amount of single-stranded DNA in response to replication stress. Collectively, these data are consistent with a model in which CDK9 responds to replication stress by localizing to chromatin to reduce the breakdown of stalled replication forks and promote recovery from replication arrest. The direct role of CDK9-cyclin K in pathways that maintain genome integrity in response to replication stress appear to be evolutionarily conserved.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), with its cyclin T regulatory subunit, is a component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, which stimulates transcription elongation and also functions in co-transcriptional histone modification, mRNA processing, and mRNA export.\"]}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant.

However, the role of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in male breast cancer has not yet been studied. To compare PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in male breast cancer to female breast cancer and to evaluate prognostic values in both groups. Tissue microarrays from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded resection material of 247 female and 164 male breast cancer patients were stained for PD-1 and PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry. PD-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was significantly less frequent in male than in female cancers (48.9 vs. 65.3%, p\u2009=\u20090.002). In contrast, PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells did not differ between the two groups. In male breast cancer, PD-1 and tumor PD-L1 were associated with grade 3 tumors. In female breast cancer, PD-1 and PD-L1 were associated with comparably worse clinicopathological variables. In a survival analysis, no prognostic value was observed for PD-1 and PD-L1 in either male and female breast cancer. In a subgroup analysis, female patients with grade 3/tumor PD-L1-negative or ER-negative/immune PD-L1-negative tumors had worse overall survival. PD-1 seems to be less often expressed in male breast cancer compared to female breast cancer. Although PD-1 and PD-L1 are not definite indicators for good or bad responses, male breast cancer patients may therefore respond differently to checkpoint immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors than female patients.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"ast cancer.

Cyclin Dependent Kinase 9 (CDK9) is one of the most important transcription regulatory members of the CDK family. In conjunction with its main cyclin partner-Cyclin T1, it forms the Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) whose primary function in eukaryotic cells is to mediate the positive transcription elongation of nascent mRNA strands, by phosphorylating the S2 residues of the YSPTSPS tandem repeats at the C-terminus domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II). To aid in this process, P-TEFb also simultaneously phosphorylates and inactivates a number of negative transcription regulators like 5,6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) Sensitivity-Inducing Factor (DSIF) and Negative Elongation Factor (NELF). Significantly enhanced activity of CDK9 is observed in multiple cancer types, which is universally associated with significantly shortened Overall Survival (OS) of the patients. In these cancer types, CDK9 regulates a plethora of cellular functions including proliferation, survival, cell cycle regulation, DNA damage repair and metastasis. Due to the extremely critical role of CDK9 in cancer cells, inhibiting its functions has been the subject of intense research, resulting the development of multiple, increasingly specific small-molecule inhibitors, some of which are presently in clinical trials. The search for newer generation CDK9 inhibitors with higher specificity and lower potential toxicities and suitable combination therapies continues. In fact, the Phase I clinical trials of the latest, highly specific CDK9 inhibitor BAY1251152, against different solid tumors have shown good anti-tumor and on-target activities and pharmacokinetics, combined with manageable safety profile while the phase I and II clinical trials of another inhibitor AT-7519 have been undertaken or are undergoing. To enhance the effectiveness and target diversity and reduce potential drug-resistance, the future of CDK9 inhibition would likely involve combining CDK9 inhibitors with inhibitors like those against BRD4, SEC, MYC, MCL-1 and HSP90.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Cyclin Dependent Kinase 9 (CDK9) is one of the most important transcription regulatory members of the CDK family.

The thymus is critical for central tolerance and diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire development, to provide lifelong defense against pathogens while maintaining self-tolerance. Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses.

Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition.

The receptor tyrosine kinase FLT-3 is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia; however, current small molecule inhibitors suffer from limited efficacy in the clinic. Conversion of a FLT-3 inhibitor (quizartinib) into a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) results in a compound that induces degradation of FLT-3 ITD mutant at low nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, the PROTAC is capable of inhibiting cell growth more potently than the warhead alone while inhibiting fewer off-target kinases. This enhanced antiproliferative activity occurs, despite a slight reduction in the PROTAC's kinase inhibitory activity, via an increased level of apoptosis induction suggesting nonkinase roles for the FLT-3 ITD protein. Additionally, the PROTAC is capable of inducing FLT-3 ITD degradation in vivo. These results suggest that degradation of FLT-3 ITD may provide a useful method for therapeutic intervention.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Conversion of a FLT-3 inhibitor (quizartinib) into a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) results in a compound that induces degradation of FLT-3 ITD mutant at low nanomolar concentrations.\"]}"}]}

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, X-linked, fatal, degenerative neuromuscular disease caused by DMD gene mutations. A relationship between exon skipping and dystrophin production in exon 51-amenable patients treated with eteplirsen (EXONDYS 51\u00ae) is established. Once-weekly eteplirsen significantly increased dystrophin, with slower decline in ambulatory function compared to baseline. Long-term treatment with eteplirsen leads to accumulation of dystrophin over time and observed functional benefits in patients with DMD. Compare long-term ambulatory function in eteplirsen-treated patients versus controls. Study 201/202 included 12 eteplirsen-treated patients assessed twice/year for ambulatory function over 4 years. Ambulatory evaluations (6-minute walk test [6MWT], loss of ambulation, and North Star Ambulatory Assessment [NSAA]) were compared with matched controls from Italian Telethon and Leuven registries. At Years 3 and 4, eteplirsen-treated patients demonstrated markedly greater mean 6MWT than controls (difference in change from baseline of 132 m [95%CI (29, 235), p\u200a=\u200a0.015] at Year 3 and 159\u200am [95%CI (66, 253), p\u200a=\u200a0.002] at Year 4).

Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation.

Lung cancer is currently the highest morbidity and mortality malignancy all over the world. In the past, the treatment options available for patients with lung cancer were mainly chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but after a period of treatment, cancer cells inevitably developed resistance. With the elucidation of the immune escape mechanism of tumor cells recently, immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors, has shown unparalleled advantages in cancer treatment, becoming a new hope for cancer patients after multi-line treatment failure. Immune checkpoint inhibitors usually belong to monoclonal PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody. Pembrolizumab is one of the first immune checkpoint inhibitors approved by the FDA to treat NSCLC and is currently the only immunotherapy drug approved for first-line treatment of NSCLC in immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, there are still some problems to be solved in the clinical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as the lack of effective biomarkers to predict efficacy. Therefore, in this review, we systematically summarize the possible biomarkers that can affect the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-L1 expression and tumor mutation burden.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Pembrolizumab is one of the first immune checkpoint inhibitors approved by the FDA to treat NSCLC and is currently the only immunotherapy drug approved for first-line treatment of NSCLC in immune checkpoint inhibitors.\"]}"}]}

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33\u2009IU/l for males, 19 to 25\u2009IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"ase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin.

Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can lead to serious and potentially lethal adverse events. In recent years, several drugs have been withdrawn from the market due to interaction-related adverse events (AEs). Current methods for detecting DDIs rely on the accumulation of sufficient clinical evidence in the post-market stage - a lengthy process that often takes years, during which time numerous patients may suffer from the adverse effects of the DDI. Detection methods are further hindered by the extremely large combinatoric space of possible drug-drug-AE combinations. There is therefore a practical need for predictive tools that can identify potential DDIs years in advance, enabling drug safety professionals to better prioritize their limited investigative resources and take appropriate regulatory action. To meet this need, we describe Predictive Pharmacointeraction Networks (PPINs) - a novel approach that predicts unknown DDIs by exploiting the network structure of all known DDIs, together with other intrinsic and taxonomic properties of drugs and AEs. We constructed an 856-drug DDI network from a 2009 snapshot of a widely-used drug safety database, and used it to develop PPIN models for predicting future DDIs. We compared the DDIs predicted based solely on these 2009 data, with newly reported DDIs that appeared in a 2012 snapshot of the same database. Using a standard multivariate approach to combine predictors, the PPIN model achieved an AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.81 with a sensitivity of 48% given a specificity of 90%. An analysis of DDIs by severity level revealed that the model was most effective for predicting \"contraindicated\" DDIs (AUROC\u200a=\u200a0.92) and less effective for \"minor\" DDIs (AUROC\u200a=\u200a0.63). These results indicate that network based methods can be useful for predicting unknown drug-drug interactions.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Using a standard multivariate approach to combine predictors, the PPIN model achieved an AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.81 with a sensitivity of 48% given a specificity of 90%.\"]}"}]}

Lipoprotein-X (Lp-X) is an abnormal low-density lipoprotein frequently found in liver disease. It is regarded as the most sensitive and specific biochemical parameter for the diagnosis of intra- and extrahepatic cholestasis. Moreover, Lp-X is supposed to contribute to the development of hypercholesterolemia in cholestatic liver disease, because it fails to inhibit de novo cholesterol synthesis. This investigation will focus on the relationship between the presence of Lp-X and serum lipid concentrations in cirrhosis. The significance of Lp-X in the diagnosis of cholestasis, compared with alkaline phosphatase (AP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and bilirubin levels, will be assessed as well. The present cross-sectional study includes 212 patients with histopathologically proven cirrhosis. The detection of Lp-X and the quantification of -, beta-, and pre-beta-cholesterol was based on agar gel electrophoresis and polyanion precipitation. For the characterization of liver function, the concentrations of albumin and bilirubin, the activities of liver enzymes, and coagulation times were assessed. In a subgroup of 40 individuals, liver biopsies were re-evaluated to confirm or exclude intrahepatic cholestasis. As a result, there was no association between the appearance of Lp-X and total cholesterol concentrations. While all patients with Lp-X showed intrahepatic cholestasis (predictive value of the positive test = 1), only 16 of 28 patients with cholestasis formed Lp-X (sensitivity = 0.57). The activities of AP and of GGT, as well as the concentrations of bilirubin, were strongly elevated in most patients, with and without cholestasis. The predictive values of AP, GGT, and bilirubin were 0.77, 0.69, and 0.74 for the positive test and 0.5, 0, and 0.6 for the negative test, respectively. We conclude that Lp-X is not related to hypercholesterolemia in cirrhosis. The positive, but not the negative, Lp-X test has high predictive value for the diagnosis of cholestasis in cirrhosis. The biochemical parameters traditionally used for the assessment of extrahepatic cholestasis, AP, GGT, and bilirubin, do not support the diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis caused by cirrhosis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The biochemical parameters traditionally used for the assessment of extrahepatic cholestasis, AP, GGT, and bilirubin, do not support the diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis caused by cirrhosis.\"]}"}]}

Kidney failure causes anemia and is associated with a very high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Mildly to moderately decreased kidney function is far more common and also is associated with an elevated prevalence of anemia and CHD risk. Recent data suggest an even higher risk of CHD when both conditions are present. We investigated the association of kidney dysfunction and anemia with CHD events (fatal or nonfatal CHD or coronary revascularization procedures) and CHD and all-cause mortality over 12 years of follow-up in 14971 adults aged 45 to 64 years in the ARIC Study. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated from calibrated serum creatinine using the MDRD Study equation (< 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 excluded, n = 32). Anemia was defined as hemoglobin level < 13.5 g/dL in men (648/6746, 9.6%) and < 12 g/dL in women (1049/8225, 12.8%). The prevalence of anemia was progressively higher at lower estimated GFR < 75 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (both P < .001) for both men and women. A total of 1635 (10.9%) participants had a CHD event, 360 (2.4%) died of CHD, and 1722 (11.5%) died of any cause during follow-up. After adjustment for known risk factors, including diabetes, lipid levels, blood pressure, and use of antihypertensive medication, decreased kidney function was associated with a higher risk of recurrent CHD events and mortality from CHD and all causes. These associations were significantly stronger among participants with anemia. The adjusted relative hazards of all-cause mortality associated with moderately decreased versus normal kidney function (GFR 30-59 vs > or = 90 mL/min per 1.73 m2) were 1.7 (95% CI 1.3-2.2) in the absence of anemia and 3.5 (95% CI 2.4-5.1) in the presence of anemia (P interaction = .001). The combination of moderately decreased kidney function and anemia is associated with an increased risk of CHD events and mortality, emphasizing the need to identify individuals with these conditions and evaluate interventions to treat anemia and slow the progression of chronic kidney disease.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"BACKGROUND: Kidney failure causes anemia and is associated with a very high risk of coronary heart di\"]}"}]}

Prosopagnosia (PA) or face blindness is characterized by a deficiency in identifying familiar faces. Almost all reports are single cases or collections of unrelated patients who acquired prosopagnosia after brain injuries, strokes or atrophy of at least the right occipito-temporal cortex. Until 2001, the inborn form - in the absence of any brain lesions - was described in fewer than 20 probands exclusively of Caucasian origin. We recently found that in the German Caucasian population, congenital prosopagnosia has a very high prevalence of at least 2.5% and that it is genetically determined. It is best described by autosomal-dominant inheritance in the more than 50 families investigated. We therefore introduced the term non-syndromic hereditary PA for the congenital form of a monosymptomatic or isolated PA. This surprisingly high frequency in the Caucasian population prompted us to extend our search to other ethnic groups. We performed a questionnaire-based screening among 198 native Indian students at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi. In a then selected subset, we found after further detailed diagnostic interviews one Bengali female student with visual agnosia for face recognition only. Several other members of her large family reported the same impairment of face recognition. The segregation pattern of PA in this family is also compatible with autosomal-dominant inheritance.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Prosopagnosia (PA) or face blindness is characterized by a deficiency in identifying familiar faces.\"]}"}]}

Immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibition is a different treatment approach to chemotherapy and targeted agents: instead of directly acting on the tumor to induce tumor cell death, checkpoint inhibitors enhance or de novo stimulate antitumor immune responses to eliminate cancer cells. Initial data suggest that objective anti-tumor response rates may be higher with anti-PD-1 agents compared with ipilimumab and the safety profile may be more tolerable. This review explores the development and next steps for PD-1 pathway inhibitors, including discussion of their novel mechanism of action and clinical data to-date, with a focus on melanoma. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The first programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, pembrolizumab, was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of melanoma; nivolumab was previously approved in Japan. \", \"The first programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, pembrolizumab, was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of melanoma; nivolumab was previously approved in Japan.\"]}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity. The correlation found between these two lipid mediators indicating a link between oxidative stress and airway inflammation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the Abbreviated Injury Score of the head region (HAIS) are validated prognostic factors in traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic performance of an alternative predictive model including motor GCS, pupillary reactivity, age, HAIS, and presence of multi-trauma for short-term mortality with a reference predictive model including motor GCS, pupil reaction, and age (IMPACT core model). A secondary analysis of a prospective epidemiological cohort study in Switzerland including patients after severe TBI (HAIS >3) with the outcome death at 14 days was performed. Performance of prediction, accuracy of discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]), calibration, and validity of the two predictive models were investigated. The cohort included 808 patients (median age, 56; interquartile range, 33-71), median GCS at hospital admission 3 (3-14), abnormal pupil reaction 29%, with a death rate of 29.7% at 14 days. The alternative predictive model had a higher accuracy of discrimination to predict death at 14 days than the reference predictive model (AUROC 0.852, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.824-0.880 vs. AUROC 0.826, 95% CI 0.795-0.857; p\u2009<\u20090.0001).

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The mechanisms involved in the amplification of the mast cell response during anaphylaxis are unclear. Mouse models of anaphylaxis demonstrate the critical involvement of neutrophils. These innate immune cells are highly abundant in peripheral blood and can be rapidly activated to trigger both local and systemic inflammation. To investigate neutrophil activation in peripheral blood during acute human anaphylaxis. Patients presenting to the emergency department with anaphylaxis underwent blood sampling upon enrolment and at up to three subsequent time-points. Traditional anaphylaxis biomarkers, histamine and mast cell tryptase, were measured by ELISA and ImmunoCAP, respectively. Plasma myeloperoxidase concentrations were measured by ELISA, serum soluble CD62L concentrations by cytometric bead array, and both compared to healthy controls. In 72 patients, 37 (51%) had severe anaphylaxis, 33 (60%) were histamine positive, and 47 (70%) were mast cell tryptase positive. At enrolment, myeloperoxidase concentrations were 2.9- (95% CI: 1.3, 6.5) and 5.0- (95% CI: 2.4, 10.5) fold higher in moderate and severe patients, respectively, compared with healthy controls, and remained stable over the first 5 h following symptom onset. At enrolment, soluble CD62L was 29% (95% CI: 19, 38) and 31% (95% CI: 22, 40) lower in moderate and severe patients, respectively, than healthy controls, and was stable over the first 5 h. There were no associations between myeloperoxidase or soluble CD62L concentrations and either histamine or mast cell tryptase concentrations. These results provide compelling evidence for the involvement of neutrophils during acute human anaphylaxis, suggesting they are activated early in the reaction, regardless of mast cell activation. This important finding increases our understanding of the basic mechanisms of anaphylaxis, a necessary precursor to improving treatment and prevention.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"ed in the amplification of the mast cell response during anaphylaxis are unclear.

Cardio-renal-anemia syndrome is a combination of heart failure, kidney failure, and anemia. Many advanced chronic kidney disease patients have both anemia and chronic heart failure. They have often hyperhomocysteinemia, high dimethylarginine values and low erythropoietin levels. Nephrologists treat advanced chronic kidney disease patients with erythropoiesis stimulating agents to improve anemia, renal and heart disease. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents, though considered essential to improve anemia in chronic kidney disease patients, have shown no significant protective effect on cardiovascular disease when used in large clinical trials targeting normal hemoglobin levels. It is possible that the high amounts of these drugs, given to reach normal hemoglobin values, may have counterbalanced the positive effect on endothelium obtained with low doses. Many studies have shown that erythropoietin improves endothelial function in animals with high dimethylarginine levels, lowering asymmetric dimethylarginine and increasing nitric oxide synthesis. Advanced chronic kidney disease patients have also high homocysteine levels which further reduce endothelial function by increasing asymmetric dimethylarginine. Homocysteine-lowering vitamin B treatment has been associated to a significant reduction of cardiovascular disease in advanced chronic kidney disease patients. Low doses of epoetin and B vitamins may improve cardiovascular morbidity by reducing asymmetric dimethylarginine and by increasing nitric oxide synthase activity. This review analyses the interaction between erythropoietin, dimethylarginine and homocysteine, and their role in cardio-renal-anemia syndrome.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Many advanced chronic kidney disease patients have both anemia and chronic heart failure.\"]}"}]}

In this review article we provide a critical insight into recent reports evaluating innovative therapies for warm type autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA). Among published articles, we selected two reports on the use of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in association with dexamethasone or rituximab, one study on the spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor fostamatinib, and a retrospective study on recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO). Among recent scientific communications, we discussed a report on the phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta inhibitor (PI3K\u03b4i) parsaclisib. All studies highlighted a good efficacy although to be confirmed in larger trials and with limitations due to the heterogeneity of wAIHA patients enrolled, the small number of subjects, the concomitant medications allowed, and the short follow-up. Ongoing trials include new B-cell/plasma-cell targeting agents such as the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors ibrutinib and rilzabrutinib, and the anti-CD38 MoAbs daratumumab and its analogue isatuximab. Further drugs in clinical trials target the complement cascade in wAIHA with complement activation, such as the C3 inhibitor pegcetacoplan and the C1q inhibitor ANX005. Finally, an interesting and non-immuno-toxic strategy is to remove the pathogenic autoantibodies via blocking the neonatal Fc receptor, by intravenous nipocalimab and subcutaneous RVT-1401. Such novel agents targeting the several immunopathological mechanisms acting in wAIHA and their possible combination, will increase the therapeutic armamentarium and possibly fill the gap of wAIHA relapsed after/refractory to rituximab. Moreover, these new target therapies may represent a tool for the unmet need of very acute cases.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Ongoing trials include new B-cell/plasma-cell targeting agents such as the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors ibrutinib and rilzabrutinib, and the anti-CD38 MoAbs daratumumab and its analogue isatuximab. \"]}"}]}

Based on very high response rates in the relapsed and refractory setting, brentuximab vedotin and the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have quickly been incorporated into clinical trials for first- and second-line therapy of Hodgkin lymphoma. Preliminary data show that brentuximab vedotin alone is not adequate therapy for newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma in older patients, but modestly decreases the risk of relapse when combined with adriamycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine in patients with previously untreated advanced-stage disease. In second-line therapy, combining brentuximab vedotin with conventional chemotherapy or with PD-1 inhibitors as pretransplant salvage is associated with high overall and complete response rates, although further follow up is needed to assess whether posttransplant outcomes are improved. Although these new drugs are well tolerated when given as single agents, unexpected toxicities have been encountered with combination regimens, specifically severe pulmonary toxicity with the bleomycin and brentuximab vedotin combination and frequent infusion-related reactions. There is concern with the use of PD-1 inhibitors as first-line therapy due to the theoretical potential for more frequent or severe immune-mediated toxicities in patients who have not received prior chemotherapy. Aside from these concerns, these new agents have the potential to improve outcomes for patients even further, bringing us closer to eradicating recurrent Hodgkin lymphoma.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"e programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have quickly been incorporated into clinical trials for first- and second-line therapy of Hodgkin lymphoma.\"]}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

How Schwann cells initiate myelin breakdown in response to injury is still largely unknown. Here we report that, following sciatic nerve injury, MLKL, a pseudokinase known to rupture cell membranes during necroptotic cell death, is induced and targets the myelin sheath membrane of Schwann cells to promote myelin breakdown. The function of MLKL in disrupting myelin sheaths requires injury-induced phosphorylation of serine 441, an activation signal distinct from the necroptosis-inducing phosphorylation by RIP3 kinase. Mice with Mlkl specifically knocked out in Schwann cells showed delayed myelin sheath breakdown. Lack of MLKL reduced nerve regeneration following injury, whereas overexpression of MLKL accelerated myelin breakdown and promoted the regeneration of axons.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Here we report that, following sciatic nerve injury, MLKL, a pseudokinase known to rupture cell membranes during necroptotic cell death, is induced and targets the myelin sheath membrane of Schwann cells to promote myelin breakdown.\"]}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Catamenial pneumothorax (CP) is defined as a recurrent, spontaneous pneumothorax occurring within a day before or 72\u00a0h after the onset of menstruation. Most first episodes go undiagnosed and treated as primary spontaneous pneumothorax, and only after recurrence is the clinical suspicion of CP raised. No gold-standard management approach exists, especially in terms of managing diaphragmatic involvement. This study is a single-centre cohort retrospective study of 24 female patients who underwent surgery for pneumothorax due to diaphragmatic endometriosis between January 2008 and December 2016. Two groups were compared: a group that underwent pleurodesis alone (8 patients) and a group that underwent diaphragmatic surgery and pleurodesis (16 patients). There were differences in BMI and smoking habits between the two groups. The right diaphragm was involved more often (6vs15, p\u2009=\u20090.190). VATS was the preferred surgical approach and only one conversion occurred in the diaphragmatic surgery group (p\u2009=\u20090.470). Diaphragmatic abnormalities were present in all the patients, brown/violet spots (100%) in the pleurodesis group and perforations (100%) in the diaphragmatic surgery group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). There were no differences in days of chest tube removal and length of stay. The recurrence rate was 100% in the pleurodesis alone group while it was only 12.5% in the diaphragmatic surgery group (<\u20090.001). In our experience, diaphragmatic surgery and pleurodesis followed by hormonal therapy was an effective approach in preventing recurrence in patients with catamenial pneumothorax and diaphragmatic involvement.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"BACKGROUND: Catamenial pneumothorax (CP) is defined as a recurrent, spontaneous pneumothorax occurring within a day before or 72\\u00c2\\u00a0h after the onset of menstruation. \"]}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which harness the ubiquitin-proteasome system to selectively induce targeted protein degradation, represent an emerging therapeutic technology with the potential to modulate traditional undruggable targets. Over the past few years, this technology has moved from academia to industry and more than 10 PROTACs have been advanced into clinical trials. However, designing potent PROTACs with desirable drug-like properties still remains a great challenge. Here, we report an updated online database, PROTAC-DB 2.0, which is a repository of structural and experimental data about PROTACs. In this 2nd release, we expanded the number of PROTACs to 3270, which corresponds to a 96% expansion over the first version. Meanwhile, the numbers of warheads (small molecules targeting the proteins of interest), linkers, and E3 ligands (small molecules recruiting E3 ligases) have increased to over 360, 1500\u00a0and 80, respectively. In addition, given the importance and the limited number of the crystal target-PROTAC-E3 ternary complex structures, we provide the predicted ternary complex structures for PROTACs with good degradation capability using our PROTAC-Model method. To further facilitate the analysis of PROTAC data, a new filtering strategy based on the E3 ligases is also added.

The extent of liver fibrosis predicts long-term outcomes, and hence impacts management and therapy. We developed a non-invasive algorithm to stage fibrosis using non-parametric, machine learning methods designed for predictive modeling, and incorporated an invariant genetic marker of liver fibrosis risk. Of 4277 patients with chronic liver disease, 1992 with chronic hepatitis C (derivation cohort) were analyzed to develop the model, and subsequently validated in an independent cohort of 1242 patients. The model was assessed in cohorts with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) (n=555) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (n=488). Model performance was compared to FIB-4 and APRI, and also to the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) and Forns' index, in those with NAFLD. Significant fibrosis (\u2a7eF2) was similar in the derivation (48.4%) and validation (47.4%) cohorts. The FibroGENE-DT yielded the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) of 0.87, 0.85 and 0.804 for the prediction of fast fibrosis progression, cirrhosis and significant fibrosis risk, respectively, with comparable results in the validation cohort. The model performed well in NAFLD and CHB with AUROCs of 0.791, and 0.726, respectively. The negative predictive value to exclude cirrhosis was>0.96 in all three liver diseases. The AUROC of the FibroGENE-DT performed better than FIB-4, APRI, and NFS and Forns' index in most comparisons. A non-invasive decision tree model can predict liver fibrosis risk and aid decision making.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\".4%) and validation (47.4%) cohorts.

Several new approaches to gene therapy for the muscular dystrophies involve oligonucleotides as targeting vectors. These oligonucleotides are designed to repair genetic mutations, to modify genomic sequences in order to compensate for gene deletions, or to modify RNA processing in order to ameliorate the effects of the underlying gene mutation. Among the various approaches currently under investigation for dystrophin mutations that cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the use of chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides (\"chimeraplasts\") to repair point mutations. Studies in the mdx mouse and the GRMD dog have demonstrated that point mutations in the dystrophin gene can be corrected by chimeraplasts that have been injected into muscles. The scope of this review includes a summary of the current status of chimeraplast-mediated gene repair for dystrophin mutations, ongoing studies to apply chimeraplast-mediated gene repair to frame-shift deletions of the dystrophin gene, and major hurdles that need to be overcome to translate current experimental successes into a viable therapeutic modality for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Several new approaches to gene therapy for the muscular dystrophies involve oligonucleotides as targeting vectors.\"]}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

While on foraging excursions, fiddler crabs track their burrow location despite having no visual contact with it . They do this by path integration, a common navigational process in which motion vectors (the direction and distance of animals' movements) are summed to form a single \"home vector\" linking the current location with the point of origin. Here, we identify the mechanism by which the integrator measures distance, by decoupling motor output from both inertial and visual feedback. Fiddler crabs were passively translated to a position such that the home vector lay across an acetate sheet on the ground. After being frightened, crabs tried to escape but slipped as they did so. Detailed high-speed video analysis reveals that crabs measure distance by integrating strides, rather than linear acceleration or optic flow: the number of steps they took depended on both the length of the home vector and how large their steps were, whether they slipped and fell short or not. This is the most direct evidence to date of a stride integrator that is flexible enough to account for significant variation in stride length and frequency.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

We conducted a systematic review in MEDLINE and Embase between 01/01/2019 and 05/09/2019, for studies developing a prognostic prediction model using machine learning methods in oncology. We used the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement, Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) and CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS) to assess the methodological conduct of included publications. Results were summarised by modelling type: regression-, non-regression-based and ensemble machine learning models. Sixty-two publications met inclusion criteria developing 152 models across all publications. Forty-two models were regression-based, 71 were non-regression-based and 39 were ensemble models. A median of 647 individuals (IQR: 203 to 4059) and 195 events (IQR: 38 to 1269) were used for model development, and 553 individuals (IQR: 69 to 3069) and 50 events (IQR: 17.5 to 326.5) for model validation. A higher number of events per predictor was used for developing regression-based models (median: 8, IQR: 7.1 to 23.5), compared to alternative machine learning (median: 3.4, IQR: 1.1 to 19.1) and ensemble models (median: 1.7, IQR: 1.1 to 6). Sample size was rarely justified (n\u2009=\u20095/62; 8%). Some or all continuous predictors were categorised before modelling in 24 studies (39%). 46% (n\u2009=\u200924/62) of models reporting predictor selection before modelling used univariable analyses, and common method across all modelling types. Ten out of 24 models for time-to-event outcomes accounted for censoring (42%). A split sample approach was the most popular method for internal validation (n\u2009=\u200925/62, 40%). Calibration was reported in 11 studies. Less than half of models were reported or made available. The methodological conduct of machine learning based clinical prediction models is poor. Guidance is urgently needed, with increased awareness and education of minimum prediction modelling standards. Particular focus is needed on sample size estimation, development and validation analysis methods, and ensuring the model is available for independent validation, to improve quality of machine learning based clinical prediction models.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"methods in oncology.

Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Up to 50% of small fiber neuropathy (SFN) cases are idiopathic, but novel antibodies to Trisulfated Heparin Disaccharide (TS-HDS) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3) have been implicated in half of these cases; the role of anti-Plexin D1 is less clear. We aimed to clarify presentation and management of these patients. An 18-month retrospective analysis revealed 54 cases of cryptogenic SFN who had testing for the 3 autoantibodies. Demographics, clinical features, epidermal nerve fiber density, and Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test results were analyzed. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment response was assessed. In total, 44.4% of patients had antibodies (62.5% TS-HDS, 29.2% FGFR-3, and 20.8% Plexin D1). Male patients were more likely to be FGFR-3 positive (P = 0.014). Facial involvement was more common in seropositive patients (P = 0.034), and patients with a higher Utah Early Neuropathy Scale score had a higher TS-HDS titer (P = 0.0469), but other clinical features were not significantly different. Seropositive patients trended toward a higher SFN screening list score (P = 0.16), abnormal Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (P = 0.052), and prior erroneous diagnosis (P = 0.19). In patients who completed IVIG, examinations and questionnaires improved and mean epidermal nerve fiber density increased by 297%. TS-HDS, FGFR-3, and Plexin D1 antibodies are present in a high proportion of cryptogenic SFN cases with more facial involvement, and greater disease severity is associated with higher antibody titers.

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

Strategies for treatment and infection control differ between the two; therefore, initial differential diagnosis is important. We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics of SFTS and JSF based on symptomology, physical examination, laboratory data, and radiography findings at admission. This retrospective study included patients with SFTS and JSF treated at five hospitals in Nagasaki Prefecture, western Japan, between 2013 and 2020. Data from 23 patients with SFTS and 38 patients with JSF were examined for differentiating factors and were divided by 7:3 into a training cohort and a validation cohort. Decision tree analysis revealed leukopenia (white blood cell [WBC] < 4000/\u03bcL) and altered mental status as the best differentiating factors (AUC 1.000) with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Using only physical examination factors, absence of skin rash and altered mental status resulted in the best differentiating factors with AUC 0.871, 71.4% sensitivity, and 90.0% specificity.

Telegenetics involves the use of technology (generally video conferencing) to remotely provide genetic services. A telegenetics platform is critical for those with limitations or vulnerabilities compromising their ability to attend clinic in-person, including individuals in rural areas. As the demand for remote genetics services increases, and amidst the COVID-19 pandemic with social distancing practices in place, we conducted a literature review to examine the benefits and limitations of telegenetics and explore the views of patients and health professionals utilizing telegenetics. Searches of the PubMed database identified 21 relevant primary studies for inclusion. The majority of studies found acceptability of telegenetics to be high among patients and health professionals and that telegenetics provided access to genetics services for underserved communities. The main benefits cited include cost-effectiveness and reduction in travel time for genetics services providing outreach clinics and patients who would otherwise travel long distances to access genetics. Patients appreciated the convenience of telegenetics including the reduced wait times, although a minority of patients reported their psychosocial needs were not adequately met. Eight studies compared outcomes between telegenetics and in-person services; findings suggested when comparing telegenetics patients to their in-person counterparts, telegenetics patients had a similar level of knowledge and understanding of genetics and similar psychological outcomes. Some studies reported challenges related to establishing rapport and reading and responding to verbal cues via telegenetics, while technical issues were not generally found to be a major limitation. Some service adaptations, for example, counseling strategies, may be required to successfully deliver telegenetics. Further research may be necessary to gather and examine data on how telegenetics outcomes compare to that of in-person genetic counseling and adapt services accordingly.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Telegenetics involves the use of technology (generally video conferencing) to remotely provide genetic services.

Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory.

Experimental evidence demonstrated a crucial role of TROAP (Trophinin-associated protein) in regulating the cell proliferation of multiple tumors, while TROAP expression and function were largely unknown in glioma. We aimed to investigate the oncogenic role of TROAP and its potential mechanisms in gliomagenesis. Four gene expression databases (GEO, TCGA, GTEx and CCLE) were enrolled in our study and used for TROAP expression and survival analysis. TROAP expression was quantified by qRT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry assays in glioma tissues and cell lines. TROAP knockdown and overexpression vector were constructed and transfected into glioma cells. CCK-8, colony formation, transwell, and wound healing assays were used to evaluate cell viability, migration and invasion, flow cytometry to determine cell cycle arrest. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to screen the pathway involved in TROAP-high phenotype. The expression of cell cycle and Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling proteins were analyzed by immunofluorescence and western blot. Based on the bioinformatic analysis and a series of functional assays, we found the TROAP was enriched in glioma tissues and cell lines, its overexpression was correlated with the clinicopathologic characteristics and poor prognosis. TROAP knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and G1/S cell cycle arrest compared with control group in glioma. Mechanism analysis revealed that TROAP activated Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin pathway and upregulated its downstream targets expression, while silencing \u03b2-Catenin or Axin2 could reverse the tumor-promoting effects caused by TROAP, confirming that TROAP-induced malignant phenotype and tumorigenesis via Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling pathway.

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation.

A novel automated chemiluminescence (CL) read-out system for analytical flow-through microarrays based on multiplexed immunoassays has been developed. The microarray chip reader (MCR 3) is designed as a stand-alone platform, with the goal to quantify multiple analytes in complex matrices of food and liquid samples for field analysis or for routine analytical laboratories. The CL microarray platform is a self-contained system for the fully automated multiplexed immunoanalysis: the microarray chip, the fluidic system and the software module enable automated calibration and determination of analyte concentrations during a whole working day. The detection of antibiotics in milk was demonstrated to validate this device. There are few quantitative multi-residue detection methods for routine analysis although the EU has defined maximum residue limits (MRLs) for a number of antibacterial reagents. Therefore, an automated multianalyte detection instrument is needed quantifying simultaneously antibiotics within some minutes. Also regeneration is required to avoid replacing the assay surface. The MCR 3 uses a microarray chip, which consists of two channels for parallel measurement and regeneration. The microarray chip is designed for parallel analysis of up to 13 different antibiotics in milk applying an indirect competitive microarray immunoassay (MIA). Microspotted antibiotics are directly coupled to epoxylated PEG surfaces. As an initial example, penicillin G is quantified in milk on the MCR 3. The penicillin G surface is regenerable for 47 measurement cycles per channel. A limit of detection (LOD) of 1.1 microg/L is achieved by an assay time of 6 min.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Anaphylaxis is a sudden onset, immediate reaction that implies a risk of death. Think of a \"rule of 2s\" for anaphylaxis, which implies that reactions usually begin within 2 minutes to 2 hours after injection, infusion, ingestion, contact, or inhalation. Fatalities can be from asphyxiation from laryngeal or oropharyngeal swelling, collapse from hypotensive shock, cardiac arrest, or acute severe bronchoconstriction that causes respiratory failure and arrest. When there is activation of mast cells and basophils in anaphylaxis, chemical mediators are detectable. The preformed mediators from mast cells include histamine, tryptase, carboxypeptidase A, and proteoglycans (heparin, chondroitin sulfates). Newly synthesized mediators include prostaglandin D\u2082, leukotriene D\u2084, and platelet activating factor. Crucial actions of the mediators include an abrupt increase in vascular permeability, vascular smooth muscle relaxation, and bronchial smooth muscle contraction. Anaphylaxis can be classified into immunologic, nonimmunologic, or idiopathic based on the associated mechanism. For example, immunologic causes of anaphylaxis are those mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies acting through the Fc\u03b5R I (foods, insect venom, 32 \u03b2-lactam antibiotics), whereas non-IgE immunologic anaphylaxis is mediated without the presence of anti-allergen IgE antibodies or ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Idiopathic anaphylaxis involves mast cell activation (acutely elevated urine histamine or serum tryptase) and activated lymphocytes.\", \"When there is activation of mast cells and basophils in anaphylaxis, chemical mediators are detectable.\"]}"}]}

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and subsequent Government 'lockdown' resulted in no face-to-face clinic visits hence the motor abilities were not monitored. The aim was to investigate whether the NSAA was feasible and reliable by video assessment. Ten ambulant DMD boys were selected from the electronic hospital records. Two physiotherapists scored the boys' NSAA independently and the intraclass correlation coefficient was used to assess agreement. The video scores were compared to two previous NSAA in-clinic scores. Mean scores (SD) for clinic visit one were 22.6 (4.19) and clinic visit two 21.8 (5.3). The two physiotherapists video mean scores were 20.6 (5.66) for physiotherapist 1 and 20.6 (6.53) for physiotherapist 2. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.98 (95% CI 0.93-1.00) for the total NSAA and 1.00 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.00) for the rise time.

We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds.

Polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S underlies the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD). In activating red blood cell pyruvate kinase and glycolysis, mitapivat (AG-348) increases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and decreases the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentration, an upstream precursor in glycolysis. Both changes have therapeutic potential for patients with SCD. Here, we evaluated the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of mitapivat in adults with SCD with no recent blood transfusions or changes in hydroxyurea or l-glutamine therapy. Seventeen subjects were enrolled; 1 subject was withdrawn shortly after starting the study. Sixteen subjects completed 3 ascending dose levels of mitapivat (5, 20, and 50 mg, twice daily [BID]) for 2\u00a0weeks each; following a protocol amendment, the dose was escalated to 100 mg BID in 9 subjects. Mitapivat was well tolerated at all dose levels, with the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) being insomnia, headache, and hypertension. Six serious AEs (SAEs) included 4 vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), non-VOC-related shoulder pain, and a preexisting pulmonary embolism. Two VOCs occurred during drug taper and were possibly drug related; no other SAEs were drug related. Mean hemoglobin increase at the 50 mg BID dose level was 1.2 g/dL, with 9 of 16 (56.3%) patients achieving a hemoglobin response of a \u22651 g/dL increase compared with baseline. Mean reductions in hemolytic markers and dose-dependent decreases in 2,3-DPG and increases in ATP were also observed.

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory.

The incidence of anaphylactic reactions during anesthesia is between 1:5000 and 1:25000 anesthetics. During the IgE-mediated anaphylactic reaction mast cells release proteases such as tryptase, histamine and vasoactive mediators. The release of mediators from the mast cells and basophils is responsible for the immediate clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis. Anaphylactoid reactions can be caused directly by a release of histamine and other mediators from mast cells and basophils and they don't depend on interaction of IgE antibodies with antigen. The most frequent agents that cause anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions during anesthesia are neuromuscular blocking agents (among them the highest percent refers to rocuronium and succinylcholine), some general anesthetics, antibiotics, blood and blood products, opioids and latex. Increased tryptase concentration in serum is a marker for systemic mast cell activation. Skin tests (in vivo) are used for verification of specific hypersensitivity to drugs in patients after anaphylactic reaction. In vitro tests prove the presence of specific IgE antibodies for drugs. The plan for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions must be established before the event. Airway maintenance, 100% oxygen administration, intravascular volume expansion and epinephrine are essential to treat the hypotension and hypoxia that result from vasodilatation, increased capillary permeability and bronchospasm. As soon as the diagnosis has been made the adrenalin should be given intravenously 1 to 3 ml of 1:10000 aqueous solution (0.1 mg/ml) over 10 minutes.

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the prototype of primary humoral immunodeficiencies. Long-term follow-up studies regarding disease-related complications and outcome are scarce. Our aim was to describe the natural history of XLA. A nationwide multicenter study based on the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry was established in 2000 in Italy. Affected patients were enrolled by documenting centers, and the patients' laboratory, clinical, and imaging data were recorded on an annual base. Data on the patients (N\u00a0= 168) were derived from a cumulative follow-up of 1370 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 8.35 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis decreased after establishment of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry (84 months before vs 23 months after). Respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent clinical symptoms at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Regular immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduced the incidence of invasive infections. Affected patients developed chronic lung disease over time (47% after 40 years of follow-up) in the presence of chronic sinusitis (84%). Malignancies were documented in a minority of cases (3.7%). Overall survival for affected patients was significantly reduced when compared with that for the healthy male Italian population, and it further deteriorated in the presence of chronic lung disease. This is the first detailed long-term follow-up study for patients with XLA, revealing that although immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduces the incidence of invasive infections, it does not appear to influence the development of chronic lung disease. The overall survival of affected patients is reduced. Further studies are warranted to improve patients' clinical management and increase awareness among physicians.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory.

Anemia in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common secondary to inadequate erythropoietin production, iron deficiency, blood loss, inflammation, secondary hyperparathyroidism, uremic toxins, and nutritional deficiencies. Anemia has a variety of deleterious consequences, including associations with increased mortality and left ventricular hypertrophy. Recombinant human erythropoietin is effective in treating anemia in children with CKD, and recent studies show that darbepoetin alpha is an attractive alternative because it requires less frequent injections. Iron deficiency is a major cause of anemia that is resistant to erythropoietin or darbepoetin alpha.

The chaperonin GroEL is a megadalton-sized molecular machine that plays an essential role in the bacterial cell assisting protein folding to the native state through actions requiring ATP binding and hydrolysis. A combination of medicinal chemistry and genetics has been employed to generate an orthogonal pair, a small molecule that selectively inhibits ATPase activity of a GroEL ATP-binding pocket variant. An initial screen of kinase-directed inhibitors identified an active pyrazolo-pyrimidine scaffold that was iteratively modified and screened against a collective of GroEL nucleotide pocket variants to identify a cyclopentyl carboxamide derivative, EC3016, that specifically inhibits ATPase activity and protein folding by the GroEL mutant, I493C, involving a side chain positioned near the base of ATP. This orthogonal pair will enable in vitro studies of the action of ATP in triggering activation of GroEL-mediated protein folding and might enable further studies of GroEL action in vivo.

The Cullin-RING ligase 4 E3 ubiquitin ligase component Cereblon (CRBN) is a well-established target for a class of small molecules termed immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). These drugs drive CRBN to modulate the degradation of a number of neosubstrates required for the growth of multiple cancers. Whereas the mechanism underlying the activation of CRBN by IMiDs is well described, the normal physiological regulation of CRBN is poorly understood. We recently showed that CRBN is activated following exposure to Wnt ligands and subsequently mediates the degradation of a subset of physiological substrates. Among the Wnt-dependent substrates of CRBN is Casein kinase 1\u03b1 (CK1\u03b1), a known negative regulator of Wnt signaling. Wnt-mediated degradation of CK1\u03b1 occurs via its association with CRBN at a known IMiD binding pocket. Herein, we demonstrate that a small-molecule CK1\u03b1 agonist, pyrvinium, directly prevents the Wnt-dependent interaction of CRBN with CK1\u03b1, attenuating the consequent CK1\u03b1 degradation. We further show that pyrvinium disrupts the ability of CRBN to interact with CK1\u03b1 at the IMiD binding pocket within the CRBN-CK1\u03b1 complex. Of note, this function of pyrvinium is independent of its previously reported ability to enhance CK1\u03b1 kinase activity. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that pyrvinium attenuates CRBN-induced Wnt pathway activation in\u00a0vivo. Collectively, these results reveal a novel dual mechanism through which pyrvinium inhibits Wnt signaling by both attenuating the CRBN-mediated destabilization of CK1\u03b1 and activating CK1\u03b1 kinase activity.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The Cullin-RING ligase 4 E3 ubiquitin ligase component Cereblon (CRBN) is a well-established target for a class of small molecules termed immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs).\"]}"}]}

To provide an overview and critical appraisal of prediction models for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify relevant studies (up to November 2021). We included studies that reported prediction model development and/or validation of BPD in preterm infants born at \u226432 weeks and/or \u22641,500 g birth weight. We extracted the data independently based on the CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS). We assessed risk of bias and applicability independently using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). Twenty-one prediction models from 13 studies reporting on model development and 21 models from 10 studies reporting on external validation were included. Oxygen dependency at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age was the most frequently reported outcome in both development studies (71%) and validation studies (81%). The most frequently used predictors in the models were birth weight (67%), gestational age (62%), and sex (52%). Nearly all included studies had high risk of bias, most often due to inadequate analysis. Small sample sizes and insufficient event patients were common in both study types. Missing data were often not reported or were discarded. Most studies reported on the models' discrimination, while calibration was seldom assessed (development, 19%; validation, 10%). Internal validation was lacking in 69% of development studies. The included studies had many methodological shortcomings. Future work should focus on following the recommended approaches for developing and validating BPD prediction models.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS).\"]}"}]}

Human mast cells, by elaborating vasoactive mediators and cytokines, are the primary effector cells of anaphylaxis. A body of evidence implicates human heart mast cells (HHMCs) in anaphylaxis. These cells have been identified perivascularly, in dose proximity to myocytes and in the arterial intima in human heart tissue. The membrane surface of mast cells from human heart tissue of patients undergoing cardiac transplantation expresses the high affinity receptors for IgE (FcepsilonRI) and C5a receptors. Activation of HHMCs in vitro with anti-IgE or anti-FcepsilonRI induced the release of preformed mediators (histamine, tryptase and chymase) and the de novo synthesis of LTC4 (approximately equal to 18 ng/10(6) cells) and PGD2 (approximately equal to 18 ng/10(6) cells). Complement activation and anaphylatoxin formation occur during anaphylaxis in human. C5a caused rapid release of histamine and tryptase from HHMCs. These cells are activated in vitro by therapeutic (general anaesthetics, protamine, etc.) and diagnostic agents (radio contrast media, etc.) that may cause non-IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions. Administration of low concentrations of histamine and cysteinyl leukotrienes in subjects undergoing diagnostic catheterization caused significant systemic and coronary haemodynamic effects. Taken together, these results indicate that the human heart can be both the site and the target of anaphylactic reactions.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Human mast cells, by elaborating vasoactive mediators and cytokines, are the primary effector cells of anaphylaxis.\"]}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR T) treatment has become a standard option for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), which are refractory or relapse after two prior lines of therapy. However, little evidence exists for treatment recommendations in patients who relapse after CAR T-cell treatment and the outcome for such patients is poor. In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of a monotherapy with the bispecific CD20xCD3 antibody glofitamab in patients who progressed after CAR T treatment. We report nine consecutive patients with progressive DLBCL after preceding CAR T-cell therapy. The patients received a maximum of 12 cycles of glofitamab after a single obinutuzumab pre-treatment at an academic institution. CRS was observed in two patients (grade 2 in both patients). We observed an overall response rate of 67%, with four patients achieving a complete response and a partial remission in two patients. Interestingly, we identified increased persistence of circulating CAR T-cells in peripheral blood in three of the five patients with measurable CAR T-cells. Our data suggest that glofitamab treatment is well tolerated and effective in patients with DLBCL relapsing after CAR T-cell therapy and can enhance residual CAR T-cell activity.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Glofitamab Treatment in Relapsed or Refractory DLBCL after CAR T-Cell Therapy.\", \"In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of a monotherapy with the bispecific CD20xCD3 antibody glofitamab in patients who progressed after CAR T treatment.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) is commonly used for assessing the discriminative ability of prediction models even though the measure is criticized for being clinically irrelevant and lacking an intuitive interpretation. Every tutorial explains how the coordinates of the ROC curve are obtained from the risk distributions of diseased and non-diseased individuals, but it has not become common sense that therewith the ROC plot is just another way of presenting these risk distributions. We show how the ROC curve is an alternative way to present risk distributions of diseased and non-diseased individuals and how the shape of the ROC curve informs about the overlap of the risk distributions. For example, ROC curves are rounded when the prediction model included variables with similar effect on disease risk and have an angle when, for example, one binary risk factor has a stronger effect; and ROC curves are stepped rather than smooth when the sample size or incidence is low, when the prediction model is based on a relatively small set of categorical predictors. This alternative perspective on the ROC plot invalidates most purported limitations of the AUC and attributes others to the underlying risk distributions. AUC is a measure of the discriminative ability of prediction models. The assessment of prediction models should be supplemented with other metrics to assess their clinical utility.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) is commonly used for assessing the discriminative ability of prediction models even though the measure is criticized for being clinically irrelevant and lacking an intuitive interpretation.

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.
