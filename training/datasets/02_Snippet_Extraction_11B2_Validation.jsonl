Among breast cancers without human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification, overexpression, or both, a large proportion express low levels of HER2 that may be targetable. Currently available HER2-directed therapies have been ineffective in patients with these \"HER2-low\" cancers. We conducted a phase 3 trial involving patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer who had received one or two previous lines of chemotherapy. (Low expression of HER2 was defined as a score of 1+ on immunohistochemical [IHC] analysis or as an IHC score of 2+ and negative results on in situ hybridization.) Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan or the physician's choice of chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival in the hormone receptor-positive cohort. The key secondary end points were progression-free survival among all patients and overall survival in the hormone receptor-positive cohort and among all patients. Of 557 patients who underwent randomization, 494 (88.7%) had hormone receptor-positive disease and 63 (11.3%) had hormone receptor-negative disease. In the hormone receptor-positive cohort, the median progression-free survival was 10.1 months in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 5.4 months in the physician's choice group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.51; P<0.001), and overall survival was 23.9 months and 17.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; P\u2009=\u20090.003). Among all patients, the median progression-free survival was 9.9 months in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 5.1 months in the physician's choice group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; P<0.001), and overall survival was 23.4 months and 16.8 months, respectively (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; P\u2009=\u20090.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 52.6% of the patients who received trastuzumab deruxtecan and 67.4% of those who received the physician's choice of chemotherapy. Adjudicated, drug-related interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis occurred in 12.1% of the patients who received trastuzumab deruxtecan; 0.8% had grade 5 events. In this trial involving patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer, trastuzumab deruxtecan resulted in significantly longer progression-free and overall survival than the physician's choice of chemotherapy.

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) is an ideal biomarker for the assessment of ovarian reserve. However, its application in determining ovarian reserve reduction is restricted due to the low sensitivity of existing AMH assays. Herein, a homebrew ultrasensitive digital AMH assay (UD-AMH) was established based on a single-molecule array (SiMoA, HD-X platform), and the analytical performance of UD-AMH was evaluated systematically. The limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) of UD-AMH were 0.13 and 0.14\u00a0pg/mL, respectively, which is approximately 100-fold higher than that of the current reported general clinical AMH assay. A comparison study showed a high correlation, with r\u00a0=\u00a00.988 for the Beckman Access AMH assay and r\u00a0=\u00a00.945 for the Kangrun AMH assay. In addition, we found that the AMH concentrations of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) patients were very low (2.59 (0.86, 31.79) pg/mL) and similar to those of perimenopausal women (2.37 (0.65, 35.88) pg/mL) but significantly higher than those of menopausal women (0.43 (0.28, 1.17) pg/mL). Furthermore, we observed that the AMH concentration of most hormone therapy (HT) treated POI patients decreased sharply, suggesting that the ovarian reserve of POI patients declines over time even under HT-treatment.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) \"]}"}]}

Missing values caused by the limit of detection or quantification (LOD/LOQ) were widely observed in mass spectrometry (MS)-based omics studies and could be recognized as missing not at random (MNAR). MNAR leads to biased statistical estimations and jeopardizes downstream analyses. Although a wide range of missing value imputation methods was developed for omics studies, a limited number of methods were designed appropriately for the situation of MNAR. To facilitate MS-based omics studies, we introduce GSimp, a Gibbs sampler-based missing value imputation approach, to deal with left-censor missing values in MS-proteomics datasets. In this book, we explain the MNAR and elucidate the usage of GSimp for MNAR in detail.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Missing values caused by the limit of detection or quantification (LOD/LOQ) were widely observed in mass spectrometry\"]}"}]}

The high resolving power of the Orbitrap mass spectrometer in a high-resolution accurate mass gas chromatography (HRAM-GC-MS) system provides greater selectivity and sensitivity for the identification and quantification of volatile analytes at low parts per billion (ppb) levels. Hence, it can be applied for the analysis of pharmaceutical impurities like N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in metformin hydrochloride products (METs). Different METs extracted by a dichloromethane/aqueous system were analyzed by HRAM-GC-MS under softer electron ionization (EI) at 30\u2009eV. The accurate masses of NDMA and its internal standard NDMA-d6 were analyzed by full scan and targeted selected ion monitoring modes under 60\u2009000 and 30\u2009000 full width at half maximum at m/z 200, respectively. Data acquisition and processing were managed by Xcalibur and Trace Finder software, respectively. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) at 10 and 20\u2009ng/g were achieved, which is below the allowed daily intake of 32\u2009ng/g. The mass errors measured from experimental data were within \u00b12\u2009ppm of the theoretical values over a period of a week. Sample analysis showed that 180 out of 212 samples (85%) were below LOD and 15 out of 212 samples (7 %) were within LOD and LOQ. Only 17 samples (8%) were found to be above LOQ, comprising one active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), five immediate-release METs and 11 extended-released METs. Amongst these, seven extended-release METs and one API exceeded the daily allowed intake, 32\u2009ng/g. The validated method has been successfully applied for NDMA analysis in various forms of METs. The method is rather straightforward without an additional clean-up step. The scope can also be extended to other volatile impurities in finished pharmaceutical products.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) at 10 and 20\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2030ng/g were achieved,\"]}"}]}

Real-time PCR (qPCR) is the principal technique for the quantification of pathogen biomass in host tissue, yet no generic methods exist for the determination of the limit of quantification (LOQ) and the limit of detection (LOD) in qPCR. We suggest using the Youden index in the context of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for this purpose. The LOQ was defined as the amount of target DNA that maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity. The LOD was defined as the lowest amount of target DNA that was amplified with a false-negative rate below a given threshold. We applied this concept to qPCR assays for Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum DNA in maize kernels. Spiked matrix and field samples characterized by melting curve analysis of PCR products were used as the source of true positives and true negatives. On the basis of the analysis of sensitivity and specificity of the assays, we estimated the LOQ values as 0.11 pg of DNA for spiked matrix and 0.62 pg of DNA for field samples for F. verticillioides. The LOQ values for F. proliferatum were 0.03 pg for spiked matrix and 0.24 pg for field samples. The mean LOQ values correspond to approximately eight genomes for F. verticillioides and three genomes for F. proliferatum. We demonstrated that the ROC analysis concept, developed for qualitative diagnostics, can be used for the determination of performance parameters of quantitative PCR.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Real-time PCR (qPCR) is the principal technique for the quantification of pathogen biomass in host tissue, yet no generic methods exist for the determination of the limit of quantification (LOQ) and the limit of detection (LOD) in qPCR.\"]}"}]}

Hazelnut is a type of plant that grows in wet and humid climatic conditions. Adverse climatic conditions result in the formation of aflatoxin in hazelnuts during the harvesting, drying, and storing processes. Aflatoxin is considered an important food contaminant, which makes aflatoxin analysis important in the international produce trade. For this reason, validation is important for the analysis of aflatoxin in hazelnuts. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) are two important parameters in validation. In this study, the LOD and LOQ values have been determined using the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists (AOAC) Method 991.31, which is one of the most viable high-performance liquid chromatography analysis methods in the analysis of aflatoxin in hazelnuts. Several approaches can be used to calculate LOD and LOQ values. In this study, to calculate the LOD and LOQ values, the visual evaluation (empirical) method, the signal-to-noise method, and calibration curve approaches were applied. The most appropriate approaches were compared. Our conclusion is that the visual evaluation method provided much more realistic LOD and LOQ values.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"tion is important for the analysis of aflatoxin in hazelnuts.

A high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) method is developed for trace determination of glycols (ethylene glycol, 1,2- and 1,3-propylene glycols, and 2,3-butylene glycol) in water after derivatization with benzoyl chloride. Benzoyl esters of glycols are separated by microcolumn reversed-phase HPLC. Sensitivity and linearity of UV detection at 237 nm is compared with electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (ESI-MS) detection using selected ion monitoring. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for UV detection are 1 and 2 mg/L, respectively. For ESI-MS detection, LOD and LOQ are in the ranges 10-25 and 20-50 \u03bcg/L, respectively. LOD obtained by ESI-MS for the determination of glycols is improved by 2-3 orders of magnitude in comparison to previously published methods. The effect of the structure of isomeric glycols on their electrospray mass spectra is discussed. The method has been applied for the determination of glycols in aqueous matrixes containing high concentrations of salts occurring in nuclear waste disposal treatment.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for UV detection are 1 and 2 mg/L, respectively.\"]}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects.

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In the present study, by comparing chromatin structure and H3K27ac levels in normal and lymphoma B cells, we show that enhancer-promoter-interacting regions assume different conformations according to the local abundance of H3K27ac. Genetic or pharmacological depletion of H3K27ac decreases the frequency and the spreading of these interactions, altering oncogene expression. Moreover, enhancer hijacking mediated by chromosomal translocations influences the epigenetic status of the regions flanking the breakpoint, prompting the formation of distinct intrachromosomal interactions in the two homologous chromosomes. These interactions are accompanied by allele-specific gene expression changes.

Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) catalyze the acetyl-group transfer from acetyl-CoA to the epsilon-amino group of specific lysine residues within core histone proteins. HATs and other chromatin-remodeling enzymes have been recently shown to regulate gene activation within specific loci. To facilitate mechanistic studies, we have developed two continuous, nonradioactive assays for the prototypical GCN5 HAT. The CoASH generated in the HAT reactions was continuously measured by using a coupled enzyme system with either alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase or pyruvate dehydrogenase. The CoASH-dependent oxidation of alpha-ketoglutarate or pyruvate is accompanied by the reduction of NAD to NADH, which was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The steady-state rate constants with substrates acetyl-CoA and a synthetic peptide (corresponding to the first 20 amino acids of H3 histone) were determined. The resulting rate constants were not significantly different between the two coupled assays, providing strong validation of these methods. Rate constants were also determined using the commonly employed radioactive filter-binding assay and compared. The 1.5- to 5-fold lower values obtained in the radioactive end-point assay are discussed in terms of the technical problems and limitations of this assay. The coupled assays should be widely applicable since the production of CoASH is common to all HAT enzymes, regardless of protein substrate.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) catalyze the acetyl-group transfer from acetyl-CoA to the epsilon-amino group of specific lysine residues within core histone proteins.\", \"HATs and other chromatin-remodeling enzymes have been recently shown to regulate gene activation within specific loci.\"]}"}]}

Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) mediate the transfer of an acetyl group from the cofactor, acetyl-CoA, to the side chain amino group of specific lysines in diverse protein substrates, most notably nuclear histones. The deregulation of HATs is connected to a number of disease states. Reliable and rapid biochemical assays for HATs are critical for understanding biological functions of protein acetylation, as well as for screening small-molecule inhibitors of HAT enzymes. In this report, we present a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) for the measurement of HAT enzymatic activities. The acetyl donor was [(3)H]Ac-CoA, and a biotin-modified histone peptide served as the HAT substrate. After the HAT reaction, streptavidin-coated beads were added to induce proximity of acetylated substrate to the scintillant molecules. However, we observed strong nonspecific binding between the cofactor and the histone peptide substrates, which adversely complicated the SPA performance. To prevent this problem, a set of chemical agents were evaluated to eliminate the cofactor-substrate interaction, thus providing reliable SPA readings. With optimization, the SPA showed consistent and robust performance for HAT activity measurement and HAT inhibitor evaluation. Overall, this mix-and-measure assay does not require any washing procedure, can be utilized in the microplate format, and is well suited for high-throughput screening of HAT chemical modulators. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) mediate the transfer of an acetyl group from the cofactor, acetyl-CoA, to the side chain amino group of specific lysines in diverse protein substrates, most notably nuclear histones.\"]}"}]}

Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) catalyze the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to lysine residues of histones and play a central role in transcriptional regulation in diverse biological processes. Dysregulation of HAT activity can lead to human diseases including developmental disorders and cancer. Through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we identified several HATs of the MYST family as fitness genes for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we investigate the essentiality of lysine acetyltransferase KAT7 in AMLs driven by the MLL-X gene fusions. We found that KAT7 loss leads to a rapid and complete loss of both H3K14ac and H4K12ac marks, in association with reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and differentiation of AML cells. Acetyltransferase activity of KAT7 is essential for the proliferation of these cells. Mechanistically, our data propose that acetylated histones provide a platform for the recruitment of MLL-fusion-associated adaptor proteins such as BRD4 and AF4 to gene promoters. Upon KAT7 loss, these factors together with RNA polymerase II rapidly dissociate from several MLL-fusion target genes that are essential for AML cell proliferation, including MEIS1, PBX3, and SENP6. Our findings reveal that KAT7 is a plausible therapeutic target for this poor prognosis AML subtype.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) catalyze the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to lysine residues of histones and play a central role in transcriptional regulation in diverse biological processes.\"]}"}]}

Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are important enzymes that transfer acetyl groups onto histones and thereby regulate both gene expression and chromosomal structures. Previous work has shown that the activation of sirtuins, which are histone deacetylases, can extend lifespan. This suggests that inhibiting HATs may have a similar beneficial effect. In the present study, we utilized a range of HAT inhibitors or heterozygous Gcn5 and Ngg1 mutants to demonstrate marked yeast life extension. In human cell lines, HAT inhibitors and selective RNAi-mediated Gcn5 or Ngg1 knockdown reduced the levels of aging markers and promoted proliferation in senescent cells. Furthermore, this observed lifespan extension was associated with the acetylation of histone H3 rather than that of H4. Specifically, it was dependent upon H3K9Ac and H3K18Ac modifications. We also found that the ability of caloric restriction to prolong lifespan is Gcn5-, Ngg1-, H3K9-, and H3K18-dependent. Transcriptome analysis revealed that these changes were similar to those associated with heat shock and were inversely correlated with the gene expression profiles of aged yeast and aged worms. Through a bioinformatic analysis, we also found that HAT inhibition activated subtelomeric genes in human cell lines. Together, our results suggest that inhibiting the HAT Gcn5 may be an effective means of increasing longevity.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are important enzymes that transfer acetyl groups onto histones and thereby regulate both gene expression and chromosomal structures.\"]}"}]}

Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are enzymes able to acetylate lysine side chains of histones. They play essential roles in normal cell function as well as in pathogenesis of a broad set of diseases, including multiple cancers, HIV, diabetes mellitus, and neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, several HATs are able to acetylate various non-histone protein substrates e.g. transcription factors, enzymes involved in glycolysis, fatty acid and glycogen metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid and urea cycles, suggesting that lysine acetylation represents an important regulatory mechanism similar to protein phosphorylation. Small molecule inhibitors of histone acetyltransferases have been developed in the last years and proved to be powerful tools to provide new insights into the mechanisms and the role of protein acetylation in gene regulation.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a key signaling molecule in all kingdoms. In plants, NO is involved in the regulation of various processes of growth and development as well as biotic and abiotic stress response. It mainly acts by modifying protein cysteine or tyrosine residues or by interacting with protein bound transition metals. Thereby, the modification of cysteine residues known as protein S-nitrosation is the predominant mechanism for transduction of NO bioactivity. Histone acetylation on N-terminal lysine residues is a very important epigenetic regulatory mechanism. The transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-coenzyme A on histone lysine residues is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases. This modification neutralizes the positive charge of the lysine residue and results in a loose structure of the chromatin accessible for the transcriptional machinery. Histone deacetylases, in contrast, remove the acetyl group of histone tails resulting in condensed chromatin with reduced gene expression activity. In plants, the histone acetylation level is regulated by S-nitrosation. NO inhibits HDA complexes resulting in enhanced histone acetylation and promoting a supportive chromatin state for expression of genes. Moreover, methylation of histone tails and DNA are important epigenetic modifications, too. Interestingly, methyltransferases and demethylases are described as targets for redox molecules in several biological systems suggesting that these types of chromatin modifications are also regulated by NO. In this review article, we will focus on redox-regulation of histone acetylation/methylation and DNA methylation in plants, discuss the consequences on the structural level and give an overview where NO can act to modulate chromatin structure.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" The transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-coenzyme A on histone lysine residues is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases.\"]}"}]}

Histone modifications and more specifically \u03b5-lysine acylations are key epigenetic regulators that control chromatin structure and gene transcription, thereby impacting on various important cellular processes and phenotypes. Furthermore, lysine acetylation of many non-histone proteins is involved in key cellular processes including transcription, DNA damage repair, metabolism, cellular proliferation, mitosis, signal transduction, protein folding, and autophagy. Acetylation affects protein functions through multiple mechanisms including regulation of protein stability, enzymatic activity, subcellular localization, crosstalk with other post-translational modifications as well as regulation of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The paralogous lysine acetyltransferases KAT6A and KAT6B which belong to the MYST family of acetyltransferases, were first discovered approximately 25 years ago. KAT6 acetyltransferases acylate both histone H3 and non-histone proteins. In this respect, KAT6 acetyltransferases play key roles in regulation of transcription, various developmental processes, maintenance of hematopoietic and neural stem cells, regulation of hematopoietic cell differentiation, cell cycle progression as well as mitosis. In the current review, we discuss the physiological functions of the acetyltransferases KAT6A and KAT6B as well as their functions under pathological conditions of aberrant expression, leading to several developmental syndromes and cancer. Importantly, both upregulation and downregulation of KAT6 proteins was shown to play a role in cancer formation, progression, and therapy resistance, suggesting that they can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. We also describe reciprocal regulation of expression between KAT6 proteins and several microRNAs as well as their involvement in cancer formation, progression and resistance to therapy.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Histone modifications and more specifically \\u00ce\\u00b5-lysine acylations are key epigenetic regulators that control chromatin structure and gene transcription, thereby impacting on various important cellular processes and phenotypes.

Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) catalyze the transfer of an acetyl group from an acetyl-coenzyme A donor molecule to specific lysine residues within proteins. The acetylation state of proteins, particularly histones, is known to modulate their intermolecular binding properties and control various cellular processes, most notably transcriptional activation. In addition, deregulation of HAT activity has been linked to the development of a number of cancers; therefore, compounds that affect these enzymes have strong potential as therapeutic agents. The research presented here demonstrates three label-free HAT screening approaches, all based on the fast and direct measurement of one or more substrate-product pairs by high-throughput mass spectrometry techniques. The first approach involves monitoring all possible acetylation states of a peptide concurrently to measure HAT activity. The second approach measures acetylation reactions, on both peptides and whole protein substrates, via direct detection of the acetyl-coenzyme A cosubstrate and coenzyme A coproduct. Lastly, the authors demonstrate the ability to monitor directly the acetylation state of whole histone proteins in the same high-throughput manner using time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The generation of compound-mediated inhibition data using each of these techniques establishes mass spectrometry as a versatile, label-free, and biologically relevant screening approach to this challenging target class.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) catalyze the transfer of an acetyl group from an acetyl-coenzyme A donor molecule to specific lysine residues within proteins.

The structure of an ESA1-CoA complex reveals structural similarity to the catalytic core of the GCN5/PCAF subfamily of HAT proteins. Here we report additional structural and functional studies on ESA1 that demonstrate that histone acetylation proceeds through an acetyl-cysteine enzyme intermediate. This Cys residue is strictly conserved within the MYST members, suggesting a common mode of catalysis by this HAT subfamily. However, this mode of catalysis differs dramatically from the GCN5/PCAF subfamily, which mediate direct nucleophilic attack of the acetyl-CoA cofactor by the enzyme-deprotonated substrate lysine of the histone. These results demonstrate that different HAT subfamilies can use distinct catalytic mechanisms, which have implications for their distinct biological roles and for the development of HAT-specific inhibitors.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Yeast ESA1 is a member of the MYST subfamily of histone acetyltransferases (HATs), which use acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to acetylate specific Lys residues within histones to regulate gene expression.\"]}"}]}

This review discusses our current understanding of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or acetyltransferases (ATs): their discovery, substrate specificity, catalytic mechanism, regulation, and functional links to transcription, as well as to other chromatin-modifying activities. Recent studies underscore unexpected connections to both cellular regulatory processes underlying normal development and differentiation, as well as abnormal processes that lead to oncogenesis.

Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Carvedilol suppressed apoptosis of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC through modification of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, whose was associated with an increase of Cav 1.2 protein expression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the prototype of primary humoral immunodeficiencies. Long-term follow-up studies regarding disease-related complications and outcome are scarce. Our aim was to describe the natural history of XLA. A nationwide multicenter study based on the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry was established in 2000 in Italy. Affected patients were enrolled by documenting centers, and the patients' laboratory, clinical, and imaging data were recorded on an annual base. Data on the patients (N\u00a0= 168) were derived from a cumulative follow-up of 1370 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 8.35 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis decreased after establishment of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry (84 months before vs 23 months after). Respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent clinical symptoms at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Regular immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduced the incidence of invasive infections. Affected patients developed chronic lung disease over time (47% after 40 years of follow-up) in the presence of chronic sinusitis (84%). Malignancies were documented in a minority of cases (3.7%). Overall survival for affected patients was significantly reduced when compared with that for the healthy male Italian population, and it further deteriorated in the presence of chronic lung disease. This is the first detailed long-term follow-up study for patients with XLA, revealing that although immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduces the incidence of invasive infections, it does not appear to influence the development of chronic lung disease. The overall survival of affected patients is reduced. Further studies are warranted to improve patients' clinical management and increase awareness among physicians.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The thymus is critical for central tolerance and diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire development, to provide lifelong defense against pathogens while maintaining self-tolerance. Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity. The correlation found between these two lipid mediators indicating a link between oxidative stress and airway inflammation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Probing microarray assays in the presence of a hybridization mix retrieves precious information on hybridization kinetics. However, in common detection schemes, useful surface signals compete with the high supernatant background from labelled targets in the mix. A known solution consists in exciting specifically the microarray surface with evanescent fields. Configurations using planar optical waveguides to produce such fields are shown here to present also a dramatic excitation irradiance enhancement at the guide/surrounding matter interface. We compare theoretically and experimentally a guided excitation with a classical external excitation. A full electromagnetic analysis predicts an irradiance increase higher than 10(4) for adequately tailored waveguides. We deposited high-index TiO(2) sol-gel waveguides on glass substrates according to best simulations. Quantitative enhancement analysis exploiting actual biological fluorescent spots perfectly confirms the irradiance amplification effect of a thin waveguide. The impact of amplification on the design of biochip readers is discussed since it leaves ample margin for simple and low-cost light couplers, advantageous in affordable readers and sensor systems.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

We developed a stable, sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on the synthesis of a new sol-gel material with the ion-exchange capacity sol-gel to coimmobilize the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and enzyme. The partial sulfonated (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane sol-gel (PSSG) film acted as both an ion exchanger for the immobilization of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and a matrix to immobilize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The AuNPs/PSSG/Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) film modified electrode allowed sensitive the ECL detection of NADH as low as 1 nM. Such an ability of AuNPs/PSSG/Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) film to promote the electron transfer between Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and the electrode suggested a new, promising biocompatible platform for the development of dehydrogenase-based ECL biosensors.

Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a life-threatening, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by unpredictable, episodic swelling of the face, upper airway, oropharynx, extremities, genitalia, and gastrointestinal tract. Almost all cases of HAE are caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene resulting in a deficiency in functional plasma C1 esterase inhibitor (C1EI), a serine protease inhibitor that normally inhibits proteases in the contact, complement, and fibrinolytic systems. Current treatment of HAE includes long-term prophylaxis with attenuated androgens or human plasma-derived C1EI and management of acute attacks with human plasma-derived or recombinant C1EI, bradykinin, and kallikrein inhibitors, each of which requires repeated administration. As an approach to effectively treat HAE with a single treatment, we hypothesized that a one-time intravenous administration of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene transfer vector expressing the genetic sequence of the normal human C1 esterase inhibitor (AAVrh.10hC1EI) would provide sustained circulating C1EI levels sufficient to prevent angioedema episodes. To study the efficacy of AAVrh.10hC1EI, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to create a heterozygote C1EI-deficient mouse model (S63\u00b1) that shares characteristics associated with HAE in humans including decreased plasma C1EI and C4 levels. Phenotypically, these mice have increased vascular permeability of skin and internal organs. Systemic administration of AAVrh.10hC1EI to the S63\u00b1 mice resulted in sustained human C1EI activity levels above the predicted therapeutic levels and correction of the vascular leak in skin and internal organs. A single treatment with AAVrh.10hC1EI has the potential to provide long-term protection from angioedema attacks in affected individuals.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Almost all cases of HAE are caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene resulting in a deficiency in functional plasma C1 esterase inhibitor (C1EI), a serine protease inhibitor that normally inhibits proteases in the contact, complement, and fibrinolytic systems\"]}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The concepts of developing RNAs as new molecular entities for therapies have arisen again and again since the discoveries of antisense RNAs, direct RNA-protein interactions, functional noncoding RNAs, and RNA-directed gene editing. The feasibility was demonstrated with the development and utilization of synthetic RNA agents to selectively control target gene expression, modulate protein functions or alter the genome to manage diseases. Rather, RNAs are labile to degradation and cannot cross cell membrane barriers, making it hard to develop RNA medications. With the development of viable RNA technologies, such as chemistry and pharmaceutics, eight antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) (fomivirsen, mipomersen, eteplirsen, nusinersen, inotersen, golodirsen, viltolarsen and casimersen), one aptamer (pegaptanib), and three small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (patisiran, givosiran and lumasiran) have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for therapies, and two mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) under Emergency Use Authorization for the prevention of COVID-19. Therefore, RNAs have become a great addition to small molecules, proteins/antibodies, and cell-based modalities to improve the public health. In this article, we first summarize the general characteristics of therapeutic RNA agents, including chemistry, common delivery strategies, mechanisms of actions, and safety. By overviewing individual RNA medications and vaccines approved by the FDA and some agents under development, we illustrate the unique compositions and pharmacological actions of RNA products. A new era of RNA research and development will likely lead to commercialization of more RNA agents for medical use, expanding the range of therapeutic targets and increasing the diversity of molecular modalities.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"With the development of viable RNA technologies, such as chemistry and pharmaceutics, eight antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) (fomivirsen, mipomersen, eteplirsen, nusinersen, inotersen, golodirsen, viltolarsen and casimersen), one aptamer (pegaptanib), and three small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (patisiran, givosiran and lumasiran) have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for therapies, and two mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) under Emergency Use Authorization for the prevention of COVID-19.\"]}"}]}

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the DMD gene resulting in the absence of dystrophin. Casimersen is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer designed to bypass frameshift DMD mutations and produce internally truncated, yet functional, dystrophin protein in patients amenable to exon 45 skipping. Our primary study objective was to evaluate safety and tolerability of casimersen; the secondary objective was to characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics. This multicenter, phase 1/2 trial enrolled 12 participants (aged 7-21\u2009years, who had limited ambulation or were nonambulatory) and comprised a 12-week, double-blind dose titration, then an open-label extension for up to 132\u2009weeks. During dose titration, participants were randomized 2:1 to weekly casimersen infusions at escalating doses of 4, 10, 20, and 30\u2009mg/kg (\u22652\u2009weeks per dose), or placebo. Participants received casimersen for a mean 139.6\u2009weeks. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in all casimersen- and placebo-treated participants and were mostly mild (over 91.4%) and unrelated to casimersen or its dose. There were no deaths, dose reductions, abnormalities in laboratory parameters or vital signs, or casimersen-related serious AEs. Casimersen plasma concentration increased with dose and declined similarly for all dose levels over 24\u2009hours postinfusion. All pharmacokinetic parameters were similar at weeks 7 and 60. Casimersen was well tolerated in participants with DMD amenable to exon 45 skipping. Most TEAEs were mild, nonserious, and unrelated to casimersen. Plasma exposure was dose proportional with no suggestion of plasma accumulation. These results support further studies of casimersen in this population.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the DMD gene resulting in the absence of dystrophin.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

Targeted inhibition of the PD-L1-PD-1 pathway might be further amplified through combination of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors with novel anti-TIGIT inhibitory immune checkpoint agents, such as tiragolumab. In the CITYSCAPE trial, we aimed to assess the preliminary efficacy and safety of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) therapy as first-line treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CITYSCAPE is a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with chemotherapy-naive, PD-L1-positive (defined as a tumour proportion score of \u22651% by 22C3 immunohistochemistry pharmDx assay; Dako, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) recurrent or metastatic NSCLC with measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and no EGFR or ALK alterations were enrolled from 41 clinics in Europe, Asia, and the USA. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive voice or web-based response system, to receive tiragolumab (600 mg) plus atezolizumab (1200 mg) or placebo plus atezolizumab intravenously once every 3 weeks. Investigators and patients were masked to treatment assignment. The co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed objective response rate and progression-free survival as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 in the intention-to-treat population, analysed after approximately 80 progression-free survival events had been observed in the primary population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03563716, and is ongoing. Patients were enrolled between Aug 10, 2018, and March 20, 2019. At data cutoff for the primary analysis (June 30, 2019), 135 of 275 patients assessed for eligibility were randomly assigned to receive tiragolumab plus atezolizumab (67 [50%]) or placebo plus atezolizumab (68 [50%]). In this primary analysis, after a median follow-up of 5\u00b79 months (4\u00b76-7\u00b76, in the intention-to-treat population, 21 patients (31\u00b73% [95% CI 19\u00b75-43\u00b72]) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab group versus 11 patients (16\u00b72% [6\u00b77-25\u00b77]) in the placebo plus atezolizumab group had an objective response (p=0\u00b7031).

The most frequently reported grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse event was lipase increase (in six [9%] patients in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab group vs two [3%] in the placebo plus atezolizumab group). Two treatment-related deaths (of pyrexia and infection) occurred in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab group. Tiragolumab plus atezolizumab showed a clinically meaningful improvement in objective response rate and progression-free survival compared with placebo plus atezolizumab in patients with chemotherapy-naive, PD-L1-positive, recurrent or metastatic NSCLC. Tiragolumab plus atezolizumab was well tolerated, with a safety profile generally similar to that of atezolizumab alone.

Microsatellite stable colorectal cancers (MSS-CRC) are resistant to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy but the combination of immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICI) could be a clue to reverse resistance. Our aim was to evaluate ex vivo the capacity of the combination of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) and tiragolumab (anti-TIGIT) to reactivate the immune response of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in MSS-CRC. We analysed CRC tumor tissue and the associated blood sample in parallel. For each patient sample, extensive immunomonitoring and cytokine production were tested. We generated an ex vivo assay to study immune reactivity following immune stimulation with checkpoint inhibitors of tumor cell suspensions. Three microsatellite instable (MSI) and 13 MSS-CRC tumors were analysed. To generalize our observations, bioinformatics analyses were performed on public data of single cell RNA sequencing of CRC TILs and RNA sequencing data of TCGA. Atezolizumab alone could only reactivate T cells from MSI tumors. Atezolizumab and tiragolumab reactivated T cells in 46% of MSS-CRC samples. Reactivation by ICK was observed in patients with higher baseline frequency of Th1 and Tc1 cells, and was also associated with higher baseline T cell polyfunctionality and higher CD96 expression.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial, a landmark study completed in 1991, stratified the risk of multiple sclerosis in patients with optic neuritis. Since that time, unique biomarkers for optic neuritis have been found. The antibody against aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-immunoglobulin G (IgG) discovered in 2004 was found to be both the pathologic cause and a reliable biomarker for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. This finding enabled an expanded definition of the phenotype of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and improved treatment of the disease. Subsequently, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) IgG was recognized to be a marker for MOG-IgG-associated disorder, a central demyelinating disease characterized by recurrent optic neuritis, prominent disk edema, and perineural optic nerve enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging. Most multiple sclerosis disease-modifying agents are ineffective for AQP4-IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and MOG-IgG-associated disorder. Because there are crucial differences in treatment and prognosis between multiple sclerosis, AQP4-IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, and MOG-IgG-associated disorder, ophthalmologists should be aware of these new biomarkers of optic neuritis and incorporate their testing in all patients with atypical optic neuritis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"multiple sclerosis, AQP4-IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, and MOG-IgG-associated disorde\", \" The antibody against aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-immunoglobulin G (IgG) discovered in 2004 was found to be both the pathologic cause and a reliable biomarker for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders\"]}"}]}

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (MOG-IgG) associated disease (MOGAD) are autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). As the clinical features of NMOSD are similar to MOGAD, diagnostic confusion exists between the two diseases. To better discriminate NMOSD from MOGAD, we investigated whether the plasma levels of complement 3 (C3) and complement 4 (C4) are different in NMOSD and MOGAD during the acute attacks of the diseases. We sought to determine whether C3 or C4 has an influence on the features of NMOSD. In this observational study, data from 73 aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-IgG) positive NMOSD patients and 22 MOG-IgG positive MOGAD patients were collected retrospectively. Demographics, clinical characteristics, plasma parameters, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings will be analyzed for comparability between the two groups. Immunoglobulin-G (IgG) and albumin were measured in both plasma and CSF. Plasma levels of C3 and C4 were measured and compared between the NMOSD, MOGAD, and 42 healthy controls (HC). The correlations between plasma C3, C4, and NMOSD clinical parameters were analyzed. The ages of onset were later in the AQP4-IgG positive NMOSD group and females predominated, which differed from the MOGAD group, whose ages were younger and with a slight male preponderance. The AQP4-IgG positive NMOSD patients presented with the clinical symptoms of optic neuritis (ON) and transverse myelitis (TM), whereas encephalitis symptoms were more prevalent in MOGAD patients. CSF analysis shows that slight but not significantly higher white cell count (WCC) and protein were observed in the MOGAD group than in the AQP4-IgG positive NMOSD group. The plasma levels of IgG in MOGAD patients are significantly lower ( During the acute phase of NMOSD and MOGAD, plasma C3 and C4 may become potential biomarkers for distinguishing the two diseases and reflecting the NMOSD BBB damage.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"During the acute phase of NMOSD and MOGAD, plasma C3 and C4 may become potential biomarkers for distinguishing the two diseases and reflecting the NMOSD BBB damage.\"]}"}]}

This article reviews the cardinal clinical features, distinct immunopathology, current diagnostic criteria, relapse-related risk factors, emerging biomarkers, and evolving treatment strategies pertaining to neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). The discovery of the pathogenic aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG autoantibody and characterization of NMOSD as an autoimmune astrocytopathy have spearheaded the identification of key immunologic therapeutic targets in this disease, including but not limited to the complement system, the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor, and B cells. Accordingly, four recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of three new NMOSD therapies, namely eculizumab, satralizumab, and inebilizumab. Currently, NMOSD poses both diagnostic and treatment challenges. It is debated whether individuals who are seropositive for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG belong within the neuromyelitis optica spectrum. This discussion is fueled by disparities in treatment responses between patients who are AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative, suggesting different immunopathologic mechanisms may govern these conditions. As our understanding regarding the immune pathophysiology of NMOSD expands, emerging biomarkers, including serum neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), may facilitate earlier relapse detection and inform long-term treatment decisions. Future research focal points should include strategies to optimize relapse management, restorative treatments that augment neurologic recovery, and practical solutions that promote equitable access to approved therapies for all patients with NMOSD.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The discovery of the pathogenic aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG autoantibody and characterization of NMOSD as an autoimmune astrocytopathy have spearheaded the identification of key immunologic therapeutic targets in this disease, including but not limited to the complement system, the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor, and B cells. \", \".

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Carvedilol suppressed apoptosis of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC through modification of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, whose was associated with an increase of Cav 1.2 protein expression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged as a major threat to all healthcare systems across the globe, and it was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). The novel coronavirus affects the respiratory system, producing symptoms such as fever, cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia. The association between COVID-19 and coagulation has been previously reported. Due to several inflammatory changes that occur in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections such as alterations in the levels of clotting factors, platelet activation leads to thrombus formation in coronary and cerebral vessels, leading to myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents, respectively. Unfortunately, the progression of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is rapid in patients with and without comorbidities. Hence, the proper monitoring of thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19 is essential to avoid further complications. The implementation of guidelines for antithrombotic treatments based on the presentation of the disease is recommended. This review discusses the symptoms and mechanisms of upregulated coagulation in patients with COVID-19.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Due to several inflammatory changes that occur in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections such as alterations in the levels of clotting factors, platelet activation leads to thrombus formation in coronary and cerebral vessels, leading to myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents, respectively.\"]}"}]}

A prothrombotic state is reported with severe COVID-19 infection, which can manifest in venous and arterial thrombotic events. Coagulopathy is reflective of more severe disease and anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is recommended in hospitalized patients. However, the prevalence of thrombosis on the intensive care unit (ICU) remains unclear, including whether this is sufficiently addressed by conventional anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. We aimed to identify the rate of thrombotic complications in ICU-treated patients with COVID-19, to inform recommendations for diagnosis and management. A systematic review was conducted to assess the incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU-treated patients with COVID-19. Observational studies and registries reporting thrombotic complications in ICU-treated patients were included. Information extracted included patient demographics, use of thromboprophylaxis or anticoagulation, method of identifying thrombotic complications, and reported patient outcomes. In 28 studies including 2928 patients, thrombotic complications occurred in 34% of ICU-managed patients, with deep venous thrombosis reported in 16.1% and pulmonary embolism in 12.6% of patients, despite anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis, and were associated with high mortality. Studies adopting systematic screening for venous thrombosis with Duplex ultrasound reported a significantly higher incidence of venous thrombosis compared to those relying on clinical suspicion (56.3% vs. 11.0%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Despite thromboprophylaxis, there is a very high incidence of thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19 on the ICU.

Emerging evidence points to an association between severe clinical presentation of COVID-19 and increased risk of thromboembolism. One-third of patients hospitalized due to severe COVID-19 develops macrovascular thrombotic complications, including venous thromboembolism, myocardial injury/infarction and stroke. Concurrently, the autopsy series indicate multiorgan damage pattern consistent with microvascular injury. COVID-19 associated coagulopathy has distinct features, including markedly elevated D-dimers concentration with nearly normal activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and platelet count. The diagnosis may be challenging due to overlapping features between pulmonary embolism and severe COVID-19 disease, such as dyspnoea, high concentration of D-dimers, right ventricle with dysfunction or enlargement, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Both macro- and microvascular complications are associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Therefore, early recognition of coagulation abnormalities among hospitalized COVID-19 patients are critical measures to identify patients with poor prognosis, guide antithrombotic prophylaxis or treatment, and improve patients' clinical outcomes. Most of the guidelines and consensus documents published on behalf of professional societies focused on thrombosis and hemostasis advocate the use of anticoagulants in all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as well as 2-6 weeks post hospital discharge in the absence of contraindications. However, since there is no guidance for deciding the intensity and duration of anticoagulation, the decision-making process should be made in individual-case basis. Here, we review the mechanistic relationships between inflammation and thrombosis, discuss the macrovascular and microvascular complications and summarize the prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment of thromboembolism in patients affected by COVID-19.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Emerging evidence points to an association between severe clinical presentation of COVID-19 and increased risk of thromboembolism.

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have elevated D-dimer levels. Early reports describe high venous thromboembolism (VTE) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) rates, but data are limited. This multicenter retrospective study describes the rate and severity of hemostatic and thrombotic complications of 400 hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients (144 critically ill) primarily receiving standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation. Coagulation and inflammatory parameters were compared between patients with and without coagulation-associated complications. Multivariable logistic models examined the utility of these markers in predicting coagulation-associated complications, critical illness, and death. The radiographically confirmed VTE rate was 4.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-7.3), and the overall thrombotic complication rate was 9.5% (95% CI, 6.8-12.8). The overall and major bleeding rates were 4.8% (95% CI, 2.9-7.3) and 2.3% (95% CI, 1.0-4.2), respectively. In the critically ill, radiographically confirmed VTE and major bleeding rates were 7.6% (95% CI, 3.9-13.3) and 5.6% (95% CI, 2.4-10.7), respectively. Elevated D-dimer at initial presentation was predictive of coagulation-associated complications during hospitalization (D-dimer >2500 ng/mL, adjusted odds ratio [OR] for thrombosis, 6.79 [95% CI, 2.39-19.30]; adjusted OR for bleeding, 3.56 [95% CI, 1.01-12.66]), critical illness, and death. Additional markers at initial presentation predictive of thrombosis during hospitalization included platelet count >450 \u00d7 109/L (adjusted OR, 3.56 [95% CI, 1.27-9.97]), C-reactive protein (CRP) >100 mg/L (adjusted OR, 2.71 [95% CI, 1.26-5.86]), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) >40 mm/h (adjusted OR, 2.64 [95% CI, 1.07-6.51]). ESR, CRP, fibrinogen, ferritin, and procalcitonin were higher in patients with thrombotic complications than in those without. DIC, clinically relevant thrombocytopenia, and reduced fibrinogen were rare and were associated with significant bleeding manifestations.

Little evidence of increased thrombotic risk is available in COVID-19 patients. Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included. Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected. Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients. 150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53; 71] years, SAPSII 49 [37; 64] points). Sixty-four clinically relevant thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 150 patients, mainly pulmonary embolisms (16.7%). 28/29 patients (96.6%) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy experienced circuit clotting. Three thrombotic occlusions (in 2 patients) of centrifugal pump occurred in 12 patients (8%) supported by ECMO. Most patients (>\u200995%) had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen. No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant. Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n\u2009=\u2009145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n\u2009=\u200977) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs. 2.1%, p\u2009<\u20090.008). Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups.

On the other side, COVID-19 patients are also showing major life-threatening bleeds, especially when systemic anticoagulation is used. Pro-coagulant propensity in critically ill COVID-19 patients have been published, but very few have described the incidence of major bleeding and its characteristics.

Six cases were identified and described together with their outcome. Major bleeding occurred in six of the 25 studied patients. Four patients were on therapeutic anticoagulation at the onset of the bleed, two required embolization for bleeding control and one died from hemorrhagic shock. Half of the described cases had unusual sites of bleeding including gluteal and abdominal wall muscles. A high rate of major bleeding was witnessed in our sample of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection, with the majority being on therapeutic anticoagulation. This rate may be higher than previously reported, necessitating additional attention from the treating physician when considering empiric therapeutic anticoagulation.

To identify whether the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage is higher in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we compared the risk factors, comorbidities, and outcomes in patients intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 and those without COVID-19. We analyzed the data from the Cerner deidentified COVID-19 data set derived from 62 health care facilities. The data set included patients with an emergency department or inpatient encounter with discharge diagnoses codes that could be associated with suspicion of or exposure to COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19. There were a total of 154 (0.2%) and 667 (0.3%) patients with intracerebral hemorrhage among 85,645 patients with COVID-19 and 197,073 patients without COVID-19, respectively. In the multivariate model, there was a lower risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio 0.5; 95% confidence interval 0.5-0.6; p\u2009<\u2009.0001) after adjustment for sex, age strata, race/ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, nicotine dependence/tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, long-term anticoagulant use, and alcohol abuse.

The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing global pandemic has presented a health emergency of unprecedented magnitude. Recent clinical data has highlighted that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a significant risk of thrombotic complications ranging from microvascular thrombosis, venous thromboembolic disease, and stroke. Importantly, thrombotic complications are markers of severe COVID-19 and are associated with multiorgan failure and increased mortality. The evidence to date supports the concept that the thrombotic manifestations of severe COVID-19 are due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to invade endothelial cells via ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which is expressed on the endothelial cell surface. However, in patients with COVID-19 the subsequent endothelial inflammation, complement activation, thrombin generation, platelet, and leukocyte recruitment, and the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses culminate in immunothrombosis, ultimately causing (micro)thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. Accordingly, the activation of coagulation (eg, as measured with plasma D-dimer) and thrombocytopenia have emerged as prognostic markers in COVID-19. Given thrombotic complications are central determinants of the high mortality rate in COVID-19, strategies to prevent thrombosis are of critical importance. Several antithrombotic drugs have been proposed as potential therapies to prevent COVID-19-associated thrombosis, including heparin, FXII inhibitors, fibrinolytic drugs, nafamostat, and dipyridamole, many of which also possess pleiotropic anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects. The growing awareness and mechanistic understanding of the prothrombotic state of COVID-19 patients are driving efforts to more stringent diagnostic screening for thrombotic complications and to the early institution of antithrombotic drugs, for both the prevention and therapy of thrombotic complications. The shifting paradigm of diagnostic and treatment strategies holds significant promise to reduce the burden of thrombotic complications and ultimately improve the prognosis for patients with COVID-19.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"However, in patients with COVID-19 the subsequent endothelial inflammation, complement activation, thrombin generation, platelet, and leukocyte recruitment, and the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses culminate in immunothrombosis, ultimately causing (micro)thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke.\", \"Recent clinical data has highlighted that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a significant risk of thrombotic complications ranging from microvascular thrombosis, venous thromboembolic disease, and stroke.\"]}"}]}

The aim of this review article is to summarize the current evidence on pathologic findings, pathophysiology, coagulation and hemostatic abnormalities, D-dimer's role in prognostication epidemiology and risk factors of thrombotic complications, and the role of prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19. While existing evidence is limited in quality, COVID-19 appears to increase micro-and macro-vascular thrombosis rates in hospitalized and critically ill patients, which may contribute to the burden of disease. D-dimer can be used for risk stratification of hospitalized patients, but its role to guide anticoagulation therapy remains unclear. Evidence of higher quality is needed to address the role of therapeutic anticoagulation or high-intensity venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients.

Common thrombotic complications include pulmonary embolism, cerebral infarction, or venous thromboembolism; less commonly seen are acute myocardial injury, renal artery thrombosis, and mesenteric ischemia. Several case reports and case series have described acute myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 characterized by elevations in serum biomarkers. Here, we report the first case to our knowledge of a patient with acute coronary syndrome confirmed on catheter angiography and cardiac MRI. This patient was found to additionally have a left ventricular thrombus and ultimately suffered an acute cerebral infarction.

COVID-19 may predispose to both venous and arterial thromboembolism due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilisation and diffuse intravascular coagulation. Reports on the incidence of thrombotic complications are however not available. We evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital. We studied 184 ICU patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13%), 22 were discharged alive (12%) and 139 (76%) were still on the ICU on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31% (95%CI 20-41), of which CTPA and/or ultrasonography confirmed VTE in 27% (95%CI 17-37%) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7% (95%CI 0-8.2%). PE was the most frequent thrombotic complication (n\u00a0=\u00a025, 81%). Age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.05/per year, 95%CI 1.004-1.01) and coagulopathy, defined as spontaneous prolongation of the prothrombin time\u00a0>\u00a03\u00a0s or activated partial thromboplastin time\u00a0>\u00a05\u00a0s (aHR 4.1, 95%CI 1.9-9.1), were independent predictors of thrombotic complications. The 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections is remarkably high. Our findings reinforce the recommendation to strictly apply pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU, and are strongly suggestive of increasing the prophylaxis towards high-prophylactic doses, even in the absence of randomized evidence.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"COVID-19 may predispose to both venous and arterial thromboembolism due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilisation and diffuse intravascular coagulation.\"]}"}]}

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found.

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide, which causes an enormous number of deaths annually. However, early diagnosis of breast cancer can improve survival outcomes enabling simpler and more cost-effective treatments. The recent increase in data availability provides unprecedented opportunities to apply data-driven and machine learning methods to identify early-detection prognostic factors capable of predicting the expected survival and potential sensitivity to treatment of patients, with the final aim of enhancing clinical outcomes. This tutorial presents a protocol for applying machine learning models in survival analysis for both clinical and transcriptomic data. We show that integrating clinical and mRNA expression data is essential to explain the multiple biological processes driving cancer progression. Our results reveal that machine-learning-based models such as random survival forests, gradient boosted survival model, and survival support vector machine can outperform the traditional statistical methods, i.e., Cox proportional hazard model. The highest C-index among the machine learning models was recorded when using survival support vector machine, with a value 0.688, whereas the C-index recorded using the Cox model was 0.677. Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values were also applied to identify the feature importance of the models and their impact on the prediction outcomes.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Our results reveal that machine-learning-based models such as random survival forests, gradient boosted survival model, and survival support vector machine can outperform the traditional statistical methods, i.e., Cox proportional hazard model.\"]}"}]}

It has been shown that metrics recorded for instrument kinematics during robotic surgery can predict urinary continence outcomes. To evaluate the contributions of patient and treatment factors, surgeon efficiency metrics, and surgeon technical skill scores, especially for vesicourethral anastomosis (VUA), to models predicting urinary continence recovery following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Automated performance metrics (APMs; instrument kinematics and system events) and patient data were collected for RARPs performed from July 2016 to December 2017. Robotic Anastomosis Competency Evaluation (RACE) scores during VUA were manually evaluated. Training datasets included: (1) patient factors; (2) summarized APMs (reported over RARP steps); (3) detailed APMs (reported over suturing phases of VUA); and (4) technical skills (RACE). Feature selection was used to compress the dimensionality of the inputs. The study outcome was urinary continence recovery, defined as use of 0 or 1 safety pads per day. Two predictive models (Cox proportional hazards [CoxPH] and deep learning survival analysis [DeepSurv]) were used. Of 115 patients undergoing RARP, 89 (77.4%) recovered their urinary continence and the median recovery time was 166 d (interquartile range [IQR] 82-337). VUAs were performed by 23 surgeons. The median RACE score was 28/30 (IQR 27-29). Among the individual datasets, technical skills (RACE) produced the best models (C index: CoxPH 0.695, DeepSurv: 0.708). Among summary APMs, posterior/anterior VUA yielded superior model performance over other RARP steps (C index 0.543-0.592). Among detailed APMs, metrics for needle driving yielded top-performing models (C index 0.614-0.655) over other suturing phases. DeepSurv models consistently outperformed CoxPH; both approaches performed best when provided with all the datasets. Limitations include feature selection, which may have excluded relevant information but prevented overfitting. Technical skills and \"needle driving\" APMs during VUA were most contributory. The best-performing model used synergistic data from all datasets. One of the steps in robot-assisted surgical removal of the prostate involves joining the bladder to the urethra. Detailed information on surgeon performance for this step improved the accuracy of predicting recovery of urinary continence among men undergoing this operation for prostate cancer.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"DeepSurv models consistently outperformed CoxPH; both approaches performed best when provided with all the datasets. \"]}"}]}

Overtreatment remains a pervasive problem in prostate cancer management due to the highly variable and often indolent course of disease. Molecular signatures derived from gene expression profiling have played critical roles in guiding prostate cancer treatment decisions. Many gene expression signatures have been developed to improve the risk stratification of prostate cancer and some of them have already been applied to clinical practice. However, no comprehensive evaluation has been performed to compare the performance of these signatures. In this study, we conducted a systematic and unbiased evaluation of 15 machine learning (ML) algorithms and 30 published prostate cancer gene expression-based prognostic signatures leveraging 10 transcriptomics datasets with 1,558 primary patients with prostate cancer from public data repositories. This analysis revealed that survival analysis models outperformed binary classification models for risk assessment, and the performance of the survival analysis methods-Cox model regularized with ridge penalty (Cox-Ridge) and partial least squares (PLS) regression for Cox model (Cox-PLS)-were generally more robust than the other methods. Based on the Cox-Ridge algorithm, several top prognostic signatures displayed comparable or even better performance than commercial panels. These findings will facilitate the identification of existing prognostic signatures that are promising for further validation in prospective studies and promote the development of robust prognostic models to guide clinical decision-making. Moreover, this study provides a valuable data resource from large primary prostate cancer cohorts, which can be used to develop, validate, and evaluate novel statistical methodologies and molecular signatures to improve prostate cancer management. This systematic evaluation of 15 machine learning algorithms and 30 published gene expression signatures for the prognosis of prostate cancer will assist clinical decision-making.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"This analysis revealed that survival analysis models outperformed binary classification models for risk assessment, and the performance of the survival analysis methods-Cox model regularized with ridge penalty (Cox-Ridge) and partial least squares (PLS) regression for Cox model (Cox-PLS)-were generally more robust than the other methods.\"]}"}]}

Survival analysis mainly deals with the time to event, including death, onset of disease, and bankruptcy. The common characteristic of survival analysis is that it contains \"censored\" data, in which the time to event cannot be completely observed, but instead represents the lower bound of the time to event. Only the occurrence of either time to event or censoring time is observed. Many traditional statistical methods have been effectively used for analyzing survival data with censored observations. However, with the development of high-throughput technologies for producing \"omics\" data, more advanced statistical methods, such as regularization, should be required to construct the predictive survival model with high-dimensional genomic data. Furthermore, machine learning approaches have been adapted for survival analysis, to fit nonlinear and complex interaction effects between predictors, and achieve more accurate prediction of individual survival probability. Presently, since most clinicians and medical researchers can easily assess statistical programs for analyzing survival data, a review article is helpful for understanding statistical methods used in survival analysis. We review traditional survival methods and regularization methods, with various penalty functions, for the analysis of high-dimensional genomics, and describe machine learning techniques that have been adapted to survival analysis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Furthermore, machine learning approaches have been adapted for survival analysis, to fit nonlinear and complex interaction effects between predictors, and achieve more accurate prediction of individual survival probability.\", \" We review traditional survival methods and regularization methods, with various penalty functions, for the analysis of high-dimensional genomics, and describe machine learning techniques that have been adapted to survival analysis.\"]}"}]}

Gene expression profiling by microarray technology has been successfully applied to classification and diagnostic prediction of cancers. Various machine learning and data mining methods are currently used for classifying gene expression data. However, these methods have not been developed to address the specific requirements of gene microarray analysis. First, microarray data is characterized by a high-dimensional feature space often exceeding the sample space dimensionality by a factor of 100 or more. In addition, microarray data exhibit a high degree of noise. Most of the discussed methods do not adequately address the problem of dimensionality and noise. Furthermore, although machine learning and data mining methods are based on statistics, most such techniques do not address the biologist's requirement for sound mathematical confidence measures. Finally, most machine learning and data mining classification methods fail to incorporate misclassification costs, i.e. they are indifferent to the costs associated with false positive and false negative classifications. In this paper, we present a probabilistic neural network (PNN) model that addresses all these issues. The PNN model provides sound statistical confidences for its decisions, and it is able to model asymmetrical misclassification costs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of the PNN for multiclass gene expression data sets. Here, we compare the performance of the PNN with two machine learning methods, a decision tree and a neural network. To assess and evaluate the performance of the classifiers, we use a lift-based scoring system that allows a fair comparison of different models. The PNN clearly outperformed the other models. The results demonstrate the successful application of the PNN model for multiclass cancer classification.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Furthermore, although machine learning and data mining methods are based on statistics, most such techniques do not address the biologist's requirement for sound mathematical confidence measures.\"]}"}]}

Machine learning-based risk prediction models may outperform traditional statistical models in large datasets with many variables, by identifying both novel predictors and the complex interactions between them. This study compared deep learning extensions of survival analysis models with Cox proportional hazards models for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in national health administrative datasets. Using individual person linkage of administrative datasets, we constructed a cohort of all New Zealanders aged 30-74\u2009who interacted with public health services during 2012. After excluding people with prior CVD, we developed sex-specific deep learning and Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the risk of CVD events within 5 years. Models were compared based on the proportion of explained variance, model calibration and discrimination, and hazard ratios for predictor variables. First CVD events occurred in 61\u2009927 of 2\u2009164\u2009872 people. Within the reference group, the largest hazard ratios estimated by the deep learning models were for tobacco use in women (2.04, 95% CI: 1.99, 2.10) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute lower respiratory infection in men (1.56, 95% CI: 1.50, 1.62). Other identified predictors (e.g. hypertension, chest pain, diabetes) aligned with current knowledge about CVD risk factors. Deep learning outperformed Cox proportional hazards models on the basis of proportion of explained variance (R2: 0.468 vs 0.425 in women and 0.383 vs 0.348 in men), calibration and discrimination (all P\u2009<0.0001). Deep learning extensions of survival analysis models can be applied to large health administrative datasets to derive interpretable CVD risk prediction equations that are more accurate than traditional Cox proportional hazards models.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"BACKGROUND: Machine learning-based risk prediction models may outperform traditional statistical models in large datasets with many variables, by identifying both novel predictors and the complex interactions between them\"]}"}]}

Over the recent years, machine learning methods have been increasingly explored in cancer prognosis because of the appearance of improved machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can use censored data for modeling, such as support vector machines for survival analysis and random survival forest (RSF). However, it is still debated whether traditional (Cox proportional hazard regression) or machine learning-based prognostic models have better predictive performance. This study aimed to compare the performance of breast cancer prognostic prediction models based on machine learning and Cox regression. This retrospective cohort study included all patients diagnosed with breast cancer and subsequently hospitalized in Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2016. After all exclusions, a total of 22,176 cases with 21 features were eligible for model development. The data set was randomly split into a training set (15,523 cases, 70%) and a test set (6653 cases, 30%) for developing 4 models and predicting the overall survival of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. The discriminative ability of models was evaluated by the concordance index (C-index), the time-dependent area under the curve, and D-index; the calibration ability of models was evaluated by the Brier score. The RSF model revealed the best discriminative performance among the 4 models with 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year time-dependent area under the curve of 0.857, 0.838, and 0.781, a D-index of 7.643 (95% CI 6.542, 8.930) and a C-index of 0.827 (95% CI 0.809, 0.845). The statistical difference of the C-index was tested, and the RSF model significantly outperformed the Cox-EN (elastic net) model (C-index 0.816, 95% CI 0.796, 0.836; P=.01), the Cox model (C-index 0.814, 95% CI 0.794, 0.835; P=.003), and the support vector machine model (C-index 0.812, 95% CI 0.793, 0.832; P<.001). The 4 models' 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year Brier scores were very close, ranging from 0.027 to 0.094 and less than 0.1, which meant all models had good calibration. In the context of feature importance, elastic net and RSF both indicated that TNM staging, neoadjuvant therapy, number of lymph node metastases, age, and tumor diameter were the top 5 important features for predicting the prognosis of breast cancer. A final online tool was developed to predict the overall survival of patients with breast cancer. The RSF model slightly outperformed the other models on discriminative ability, revealing the potential of the RSF method as an effective approach to building prognostic prediction models in the context of survival analysis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"BACKGROUND: Over the recent years, machine learning methods have been increasingly explored in cancer prognosis because of the appearance of improved machine learning algorithms.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Heterologous boost vaccination has been proposed as an option to elicit stronger and broader, or longer-lasting immunity. We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of heterologous immunization with a recombinant adenovirus type-5-vectored Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine (Convidecia, hereafter referred to as CV) and a protein-subunit-based COVID-19 vaccine (ZF2001, hereafter referred to as ZF). We conducted a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, in which healthy adults aged 18 years or older, who have received 1 dose of Convidecia, with no history of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, were recruited in Jiangsu, China. Sixty participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either 1 dose of ZF2001 or placebo control (trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV)) administered at 28 days after priming, and received the third injection with ZF2001 at 5 months, referred to as CV/ZF/ZF (D0-D28-M5) and CV/ZF (D0-M5) regimen, respectively. Sixty participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either 1 dose of ZF2001 or TIV administered at 56 days after priming, and received the third injection with ZF2001 at 6 months, referred to as CV/ZF/ZF (D0-D56-M6) and CV/ZF (D0-M6) regimen, respectively. Participants and investigators were masked to the vaccine received but not to the boosting interval. Primary endpoints were the geometric mean titer (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and 7-day solicited adverse reactions. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. Between April 7, 2021 and May 6, 2021, 120 eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive ZF2001/ZF2001 (n = 40) or TIV/ZF2001 (n = 20) 28 days and 5 months post priming, and receive ZF2001/ZF2001 (n = 40) or TIV/ZF2001 (n = 20) 56 days and 6 months post priming. Of them, 7 participants did not receive the third injection with ZF2001. A total of 26 participants (21.7%) reported solicited adverse reactions within 7 days post boost vaccinations, and all the reported adverse reactions were mild, with 13 (32.5%) in CV/ZF/ZF (D0-D28-M5) regimen, 7 (35.0%) in CV/ZF (D0- M5) regimen, 4 (10.0%) in CV/ZF/ZF (D0-D56-M6) regimen, and 2 (10.0%) in CV/ZF (D0-M6) regimen, respectively. At 14 days post first boost, GMTs of neutralizing antibodies in recipients receiving ZF2001 at 28 days and 56 days post priming were 18.7 (95% CI 13.7 to 25.5) and 25.9 (17.0 to 39.3), respectively, with geometric mean ratios of 2.0 (1.2 to 3.5) and 3.4 (1.8 to 6.4) compared to TIV. GMTs at 14 days after second boost of neutralizing antibodies increased to 107.2 (73.7 to 155.8) in CV/ZF/ZF (D0-D28-M5) regimen and 141.2 (83.4 to 238.8) in CV/ZF/ZF (D0-D56-M6) regimen. Two-dose schedules of CV/ZF (D0-M5) and CV/ZF (D0-M6) induced antibody levels comparable with that elicited by 3-dose schedules, with GMTs of 90.5 (45.6, 179.8) and 94.1 (44.0, 200.9), respectively. Study limitations include the absence of vaccine effectiveness in a real-world setting and current lack of immune persistence data. Heterologous boosting with ZF2001 following primary vaccination with Convidecia is more immunogenic than a single dose of Convidecia and is not associated with safety concerns. These results support flexibility in cooperating viral vectored and recombinant protein vaccines.

Among them, 98 cases had completed vaccination, and the positivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 96% (24/25) with three doses of ZF2001. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies' positivity was 63.0% (46/73) of two doses of CoronaVac or BBIBP-CorV vaccine. Additionally, after 4 months of the last-dose vaccination, the IgG-positive rate (31.6%, 6/19) significantly decreased in thyroid cancer patients. The IgG-positive rate (81.0%, 64/79) was satisfactory within 3 months of the last-dose vaccination. Ten (10.2%) patients had side effects after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Among them, two (2.0%) patients had a fever, five (5.1%) patients had injection site pain, one (1.0%) patient felt dizzy, and one patient felt dizzy and had injection site pain at the same time. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV, and ZF2001) are safe in thyroid cancer patients. The regression time of SARS-CoV-2 IgG is significantly shorter in thyroid cancer patients than in healthy adults. Therefore, a booster vaccination dose may be earlier than the systematic strategy for thyroid cancer patients.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV, and ZF2001) are safe in thyroid cancer patients. \"]}"}]}

Breakthrough infections by SARS-CoV-2 variants become the global challenge for pandemic control. Previously, we developed the protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 based on the dimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) of prototype SARS-CoV-2. Here, we developed a chimeric RBD-dimer vaccine approach to adapt SARS-CoV-2 variants. A prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer was first designed to adapt the resistant Beta variant. Compared with its homotypic forms, the chimeric vaccine elicited broader sera neutralization of variants and conferred better protection in mice. The protection of the chimeric vaccine was further verified in macaques. This approach was generalized to develop Delta-Omicron chimeric RBD-dimer to adapt the\u00a0currently prevalent variants. Again, the chimeric vaccine elicited broader sera neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants and conferred better protection against challenge by either Delta or Omicron SARS-CoV-2 in mice. The chimeric approach is applicable for rapid updating of immunogens, and our data supported the use of variant-adapted multivalent vaccine against circulating and emerging variants.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Previously, we developed the protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 based on the dimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) of prototype SARS-CoV-2. \"]}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

Chromosome missegregation during mitosis or meiosis is a hallmark of cancer and the main cause of prenatal death in humans. The gain or loss of specific chromosomes is thought to be random, with cell viability being essentially determined by selection. Several established pathways including centrosome amplification, sister-chromatid cohesion defects, or a compromised spindle assembly checkpoint can lead to chromosome missegregation. However, how specific intrinsic features of the kinetochore-the critical chromosomal interface with spindle microtubules-impact chromosome segregation remains poorly understood. Here we used the unique cytological attributes of female Indian muntjac, the mammal with the lowest known chromosome number (2n\u00a0= 6), to characterize and track individual chromosomes with distinct kinetochore size throughout mitosis. We show that centromere and kinetochore functional layers scale proportionally with centromere size. Measurement of intra-kinetochore distances, serial-section electron microscopy, and RNAi against key kinetochore proteins confirmed a standard structural and functional organization of the Indian muntjac kinetochores and revealed that microtubule binding capacity scales with kinetochore size. Surprisingly, we found that chromosome segregation in this species is not random. Chromosomes with larger kinetochores bi-oriented more efficiently and showed a 2-fold bias to congress to the equator in a motor-independent manner. Despite robust correction mechanisms during unperturbed mitosis, chromosomes with larger kinetochores were also strongly biased to establish erroneous merotelic attachments and missegregate during anaphase. This bias was impervious to the experimental attenuation of polar ejection forces on chromosome arms by RNAi against the chromokinesin Kif4a. Thus, kinetochore size is an important determinant of chromosome segregation fidelity.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Here we used the unique cytological attributes of female Indian muntjac, the mammal with the lowest known chromosome number (2n\\u00c2\\u00a0= 6),\", \"Here we used the unique cytological attributes of female Indian muntjac, the mammal with the lowest known chromosome number (2n\\u00c2\\u00a0= 6), to characterize and track individual chromosomes with distinct kinetochore size throughout mitosis.\", \" Here we used the unique cytological attributes of female Indian muntjac, the mammal with the lowest known chromosome number (2n\\u00c2\\u00a0= 6), to characterize and track individual chromosomes with distinct kinetochore size throughout mitosis.\"]}"}]}

During cell division in eukaryotes a microtubule-based network undergoes drastic changes and remodeling to assemble a mitotic spindle competent to segregate chromosomes. Several model systems have been widely used to dissect the molecular and structural mechanisms behind mitotic spindle assembly and function. These include budding and fission yeasts, which are ideal for genetic and molecular approaches, but show limitations in high-resolution live-cell imaging, while being evolutionarily distant from humans. On the other hand, systems that were historically used for their exceptional properties for live-cell imaging of mitosis (e.g., newt lung cells and Haemanthus endosperm cells) lack the necessary genomic tools for molecular studies. In a CRISPR-Cas9 era, human cultured cells have conquered the privilege to be positioned among the most powerful genetically manipulatable systems, but their high chromosome number remains a significant bottleneck for the molecular dissection of mitosis in mammals. We believe that we can significantly broaden this scenario by establishing a unique placental mammal model system that combines the powerful genetic tools and low chromosome number of fission yeast and Drosophila melanogaster, with the exceptional cytological features of a rat kangaroo cell. This system is based on hTERT-immortalized fibroblasts from a female Indian muntjac, a placental mammal with the lowest known chromosome number (n\u00a0=\u00a03). Here we describe a series of methodologies established in our laboratory for the study of mitosis in Indian muntjac. These include standard techniques such as immunofluorescence, western blotting, and FISH, but also several state-of-the-art methodologies, including live-cell imaging, cell confinement, RNAi, super-resolution STED microscopy, and laser microsurgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Indian Muntjac, a Placental Mammal with Only Three Chromosomes.\", \" Indian muntjac, a placental mammal with the lowest known chromosome number (n\\u00c2\\u00a0=\\u00c2\\u00a03).\"]}"}]}

The Indian muntjac is believed to have the lowest chromosome number in mammals (2n = 6 in females and 2n = 7 in males). It has been suggested that a series of tandem chromosome fusions from an ancestral Chinese muntjac-like species (2n = 46) may have occurred during the karyotypic evolution of the Indian muntjac. In an earlier study, hybridization signals generated by the Chinese muntjac centromeric heterochromatin DNA probe (C5) were found to be distributed interstitially in the chromosomes of the Indian muntjac, providing supportive evidence for the tandem chromosome fusion theory. In this study, the highly conserved human telomeric DNA sequence (TTAGGG)n was localized by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on the metaphase chromosomes of three Cervidae species: the Indian muntjac, Chinese muntjac, and woodland caribou. As expected, hybridization signals were observed at the termini of almost every chromosome in all three species. In addition, interstitial hybridization signals were detected in chromosomes 1 and 2 of the Indian muntjac. The observed interstitial telomeric signals appeared to correspond to specific interstitial centromeric heterochromatin sites. These interstitial telomeric signals could represent remnant DNA sequences from the ancestral species telomeres, further supporting the tandem chromosome fusion theory. Furthermore, these observations permit the elucidation of the chromosome sites where breakage and fusion most likely occurred during the restructuring of the ancestral Chinese muntjac-like chromosomes to form the present day Indian muntjac karyotype.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The Indian muntjac is believed to have the lowest chromosome number in mammals (2n = 6 in females and 2n = 7 in males).\"]}"}]}

Chromosome segregation in mammals relies on the maturation of a thick bundle of kinetochore-attached microtubules known as k-fiber. How k-fibers mature from initial kinetochore microtubule attachments remains a fundamental question. By combining molecular perturbations and phenotypic analyses in Indian muntjac fibroblasts containing the lowest known diploid chromosome number in mammals (2N\u00a0= 6) and distinctively large kinetochores, with fixed/live-cell super-resolution coherent-hybrid stimulated emission depletion (CH-STED) nanoscopy and laser microsurgery, we demonstrate a key role for augmin in kinetochore microtubule self-organization and maturation, regardless of pioneer centrosomal microtubules. In doing so, augmin promotes kinetochore and interpolar microtubule turnover and poleward flux. Tracking of microtubule growth events within individual k-fibers reveals a wide angular dispersion, consistent with augmin-mediated branched microtubule nucleation. Augmin depletion reduces the frequency of kinetochore microtubule growth events and hampers efficient repair after acute k-fiber injury by laser microsurgery. Together, these findings underscore the contribution of augmin-mediated microtubule amplification for k-fiber self-organization and maturation in mammals.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"By combining molecular perturbations and phenotypic analyses in Indian muntjac fibroblasts containing the lowest known diploid chromosome number in mammals (2N\\u00c2\\u00a0= 6) and distinctively large kinetochores, with fixed/live-cell super-resolution coherent-hybrid stimulated emission depletion (CH-STED) nanoscopy and laser microsurgery, we demonstrate a key role for augmin in kinetochore microtubule self-organization and maturation, regardless of pioneer centrosomal microtubules.\"]}"}]}

We present, here, comparative results based on draft sequences of 37 bacterial artificial clones (BAC) clones selected by chromosome painting for this special muntjac species. Sequence comparison on these BAC clones uncovered sequence syntenic relationships between the muntjac genome and those of other mammals. We found that the muntjac genome has peculiar features with respect to intron size and evolutionary rates of genes. Inspection of more than 80 pairs of orthologous introns from 15 genes reveals a significant reduction in intron size in the Indian muntjac compared to that of human, mouse, and dog. Evolutionary analysis using 19 genes indicates that the muntjac genes have evolved rapidly compared to other mammals. In addition, we identified and characterized sequence composition of the first BAC clone containing a chromosomal fusion site.

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects.

They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Histone methylation represents one of the most critical epigenetic events in DNA function regulation in eukaryotic organisms. Classic molecular biology and genetics tools provide significant knowledge about mechanisms and physiological roles of histone methyltransferases and demethylases in various cellular processes. In addition to this stream line, development and application of chemistry and chemistry-related techniques are increasingly involved in biological study, and offer information otherwise difficult to obtain by standard molecular biology methods. Herein, we review recent achievements and progress in developing and applying chemical and biochemical approaches in the study of histone methylation, including chromatin immunoprecipitation, chemical ligation, mass spectrometry, biochemical methylation and demethylation assays, and inhibitor development. These technological advances allow histone methylation to be studied from genome-wide level to molecular and atomic levels. With ChIP technology, information can be obtained about precise mapping of histone methylation patterns at specific promoters, genes, or other genomic regions. MS is particularly useful in detecting and analyzing methylation marks in histone and nonhistone protein substrates. Chemical approaches that permit site-specific incorporation of methyl groups into histone proteins greatly facilitate the investigation of biological impacts of methylation at individual modification sites. Discovery and design of selective organic inhibitors of histone methyltransferases and demethylases provide chemical probes to interrogate methylation-mediated cellular pathways. Overall, these chemistry-related technological advances have greatly improved our understanding of the biological functions of histone methylation in normal physiology and diseased states, and also are of great potential to translate basic epigenetics research into diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the clinic.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Histone methylation represents one of the most critical epigenetic events in DNA function regulation in eukaryotic organisms.\"]}"}]}

Studies into posttranslational modifications of histones, notably acetylation, have yielded important insights into the dynamic nature of chromatin structure and its fundamental role in gene expression. The roles of other covalent histone modifications remain poorly understood. To gain further insight into histone methylation, we investigated its occurrence and pattern of site utilization in Tetrahymena, yeast, and human HeLa cells. In Tetrahymena, transcriptionally active macronuclei, but not transcriptionally inert micronuclei, contain a robust histone methyltransferase activity that is highly selective for H3. Microsequence analyses of H3 from Tetrahymena, yeast, and HeLa cells indicate that lysine 4 is a highly conserved site of methylation, which to date, is the major site detected in Tetrahymena and yeast. These data document a nonrandom pattern of H3 methylation that does not overlap with known acetylation sites in this histone. In as much as H3 methylation at lysine 4 appears to be specific to macronuclei in Tetrahymena, we suggest that this modification pattern plays a facilitatory role in the transcription process in a manner that remains to be determined. Consistent with this possibility, H3 methylation in yeast occurs preferentially in a subpopulation of H3 that is preferentially acetylated.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Studies into posttranslational modifications of histones, notably acetylation, have yielded important insights into the dynamic nature of chromatin structure and its fundamental role in gene expression.\", \"Microsequence analyses of H3 from Tetrahymena, yeast, and HeLa cells indicate that lysine 4 is a highly conserved site of methylation, which to date, is the major site detected in Tetrahymena and yeast.\", \"Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 is highly conserved and correlates with transcriptionally active nuclei in Tetrahymena.\"]}"}]}

Chromatin remodelling events play an important role in the secondary metabolism of filamentous fungi. Previously, we showed that a bacterium, Streptomyces rapamycinicus, is able to reprogram the histone-modifying Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase/ADA (SAGA/ADA) complex of the model fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Consequently, the histone H3 amino acids lysine 9 and lysine 14 at distinct secondary metabolism genes were specifically acetylated during the bacterial fungal interaction, which, furthermore, was associated with the activation of the otherwise silent orsellinic acid gene cluster. To investigate the importance of the histone modifications for distinct gene expression profiles in fungal secondary metabolism, we exchanged several amino acids of histone H3 of A. nidulans. These amino acids included lysine residues 9, 14, 18, and 23 as well as serine 10 and threonine 11. Lysine residues were replaced by arginine or glutamine residues, and serine/threonine residues were replaced by alanine. All generated mutant strains were viable, allowing direct analysis of the consequences of missing posttranslational histone modifications. In the mutant strains, major changes in the expression patterns at both the transcriptional and metabolite levels of the penicillin, sterigmatocystin, and orsellinic acid biosynthesis gene clusters were detected. These effects were due mainly to the substitution of the acetylatable lysine 14 of histone H3 and were enhanced in a lysine 14/lysine 9 double mutant of histone H3. Taken together, our findings show a causal linkage between the acetylation of lysine residue 14 of histone H3 and the transcription and product formation of secondary metabolite gene clusters. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Chromatin remodelling events play an important role in the secondary metabolism of filamentous fungi.

Histones are the major protein constituent of chromatin in the eukaryotic nucleus.

Structures of several representatives of these HMT families have recently been determined, yielding insight into their catalytic mechanism and histone substrate specificity.

Histone modifications; acetylation, methylation (both Lysine and Arginine) etc., at different positions regulates the chromatin fluidity and function in a combinatorial manner, which could be referred as an epigenetic language. In the context of transcription, histone acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation at specific sites, especially at the N-terminal tails of histones play very important roles in activation and/or repression. While acetylation of histones is generally important for transcriptional activation, methylation and phosphorylation could also be involved in repression, depending on the context. Here, we have investigated the crosstalk of histone modifications on a gross scale over histone H3, using a small molecule inhibitor of lysine acetyltransferase KAT3B/p300, Plumbagin, to analyze the histone modification profile upon inhibition of acetylation. In addition to the inhibition of acetylation, there was a concomitant decrease of transcriptional activation mark, H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in the cellular context. The histone H3 Serine 10 Phosphorylation (H3S10p) also decreased upon inhibition of acetylation. However, there were no changes observed with transcriptional repressive marks like H3 Lysine 9 di/trimethylation (H3K9me2/me3) suggesting that transcriptional activation marks were selectively targeted. These data suggest that Plumbagin induces a distinct modification profile involving transcriptional activation marks H3K4me3 and H3S10 phosphorylation in the context of histone acetylation brought about by KAT3B/ p300.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Histone modifications; acetylation, methylation (both Lysine and Arginine) etc., at different positions regulates the chromatin fluidity and function in a combinatorial manner, which could be referred as an epigenetic language.\"]}"}]}

Post-translational histone modifications such as acetylation and methylation can affect gene expression. Histone acetylation is commonly associated with activation of gene expression whereas histone methylation is linked to either activation or repression of gene expression. Depending on the site of histone modification, several histone marks can be present throughout the genome. A combination of these histone marks can shape global chromatin architecture, and changes in patterns of marks can affect the transcriptomic landscape. Alterations in several histone marks are associated with different types of cancers, and these alterations are distinct from marks found in original normal tissues. Therefore, it is hypothesized that patterns of histone marks can change during the process of tumorigenesis.This review focuses on histone methylation changes (both removal and addition of methyl groups) in malignant melanoma, a deadly skin cancer, and the implications of specific inhibitors of these modifications as a combinatorial therapeutic approach.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Histone acetylation is commonly associated with activation of gene expression whereas histone methylation is linked to either activation or repression of gene expression.\"]}"}]}

Lysine residue 9 of histone H3 can either be acetylated or mono-, di-, or tri-methylated. These epigenetic states have a diverse impact on regulating gene transcriptional activity and chromatin organization. H3K9ac is invariably correlated with transcriptional activation, whereas H3K9me2 has been reported to be mainly located in constitutive heterochromatin in Arabidopsis. Here, we present epigenetic landscapes for histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) and dimethylation (H3K9me2) in Arabidopsis seedlings. The results show that H3K9ac targeted 5,206 non-transposable element (non-TE) genes and 321 transposable elements (TEs), whereas H3K9me2 targeted 2,281 TEs and 1,112 non-TE genes. H3K9ac was biased towards the 5' end of genes and peaked at the ATG position, while H3K9me2 tended to span the entire gene body. H3K9ac correlated with high gene expression, while H3K9me2 correlated with low expression. Analyses of H3K9ac and H3K9me2 with the available datasets of H3K27me3 and DNA methylation revealed a correlation between the occurrence of multiple epigenetic modifications and gene expression. Genes with H3K9ac alone were actively transcribed, while genes that were also modified by either H3K27me3 or DNA methylation showed a lower expression level, suggesting that a combination of repressive marks weakened the positive regulatory effect of H3K9ac. Furthermore, we observed a significant increase of the H3K9ac modification level of selected target genes in hda19 (histone deacetylase 19) mutant seedlings, which indicated that HDA19 plays an important role in regulating the level of H3K9ac and thereby influencing the transcriptional activity in young seedlings.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Lysine residue 9 of histone H3 can either be acetylated or mono-, di-, or tri-methylated.\"]}"}]}

Recent studies on the lysine methylation of histones have moved rapidly thanks to the discoveries of a variety of histone lysine methyltransferases. Histone lysine methylation is known to either activate or repress gene expression depending upon the position and status of the methylated lysine residue. Recently, an increasing number of lysine methyltransferases have been identified to modify non-histone proteins. Among those enzymes, the most extensively studied is Set9, a SET domain-containing lysine methyltransferase. Set9 was initially found to target histone H3 lysine 4 for monomethylation and was subsequently shown to target a variety of non-histone proteins, especially transcription-related factors. Functional studies revealed that Set9-mediated methylation of different non-histone proteins leads to distinct biological consequences, most of which point to protein stability.

However, the enzymes that antagonize methylation on K27 of histone H3 (H3K27), an epigenetic mark important for embryonic stem cell maintenance, Polycomb-mediated gene silencing, and X chromosome inactivation have been elusive. Here we show the JmjC domain-containing protein UTX (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat, X chromosome), as well as the related JMJD3 (jumonji domain containing 3), specifically removes methyl marks on H3K27 in vitro. Further, the demethylase activity of UTX requires a catalytically active JmjC domain. Finally, overexpression of UTX and JMJD3 leads to reduced di- and trimethylation on H3K27 in cells, suggesting that UTX and JMJD3 may function as H3K27 demethylases in vivo. The identification of UTX and JMJD3 as H3K27-specific demethylases provides direct evidence to indicate that similar to methylation on K4, K9, and K36 of histone H3, methylation on H3K27 is also reversible and can be dynamically regulated by site-specific histone methyltransferases and demethylases.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Histone lysine methylation has been implicated in both gene activation and repression, depending on the specific lysine (K) residue that becomes methylated and the state of methylation (mono-, di-, or trimethylation).\"]}"}]}

Histone acetylation and methylation are linked to a variety of nuclear activities, most notably transcriptional regulation. Both synergistic and antagonistic relationships between these two modifications have been reported in different systems. Here we show that the budding yeast histone H4 arginine 3 (R3) methyltransferase Hmt1p binds acetylated histones H3 and H4, and importantly, that acetylated H4 is a significantly better methylation substrate for Hmt1p. Kinetic studies show that acetylation at any of the four acetylatable lysine residues of histone H4 results in more efficient methylation. Among the four, K8 acetylation imposes the strongest effect on reducing K(M), consistent with the observed acetylation-stimulated interaction. In vivo, hmt1Delta cells rescue the transcriptional defect caused by GCN5 deletion, indicating that one of the functions of Gcn5p is to neutralize the negative effect of Hmt1p. Mutating either K8 or R3 to alanine causes similar growth defects in selective histone and gcn5 mutant background, suggesting that these two residues function in the same pathway for optimal vegetative growth. Together, these results reveal a functional connection between histone acetylation, methylation, and two of the responsible enzymes, Gcn5p and Hmt1p.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Kinetic studies show that acetylation at any of the four acetylatable lysine residues of histone H4 results in more efficient methylation.\"]}"}]}

The packaging of DNA around nucleosomes exerts dynamic control over eukaryotic gene expression either by granting access to the transcriptional machinery in an open chromatin state or by silencing transcription via chromatin compaction. Histone methylation modification affects chromatin through the addition of methyl groups to lysine or arginine residues of histones H3 and H4 by means of histone methyl transferases or histone demethylases. Changes in histone methylation state modulate periodontal gene expression and have profound effects on periodontal development, health, and therapy. At the onset of periodontal development, progenitor cell populations such as dental follicle cells are characterized by an open H3K4me3 chromatin mark on RUNX2, MSX2, and DLX5 gene promoters. During further development, periodontal progenitor differentiation undergoes a global switch from the H3K4me3 active methyl mark to the H3K27me3 repressive mark. When compared with dental pulp cells, periodontal neural crest lineage differentiation is characterized by repressive H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 marks on typical dentinogenesis-related genes. Inflammatory conditions as they occur during periodontal disease result in unique histone methylation signatures in affected cell populations, including repressive H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 histone marks on extracellular matrix gene promoters and active H3K4me3 marks on interleukin, defensin, and chemokine gene promoters, facilitating a rapid inflammatory response to microbial pathogens. The inflammation-induced repression of chromatin on extracellular matrix gene promoters presents a therapeutic opportunity for the application of histone methylation inhibitors capable of inhibiting suppressive trimethylation marks. Furthermore, inhibition of chromatin coregulators through interference with key inflammatory mediators such as NF-kB by means of methyltransferase inhibitors provides another avenue to halt the exacerbation of the inflammatory response in periodontal tissues. In conclusion, histone methylation dynamics play an intricate role in the fine-tuning of chromatin states during periodontal development and harbor yet-to-be-realized potential for the treatment of periodontal disease.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Histone methylation modification affects chromatin through the addition of methyl groups to lysine or arginine residues of histones H3 and H4 by means of histone methyl transferases or histone demethylases.\"]}"}]}

A key event in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression is the posttranslational modification of nucleosomal histones, which converts regions of chromosomes into transcriptionally active or inactive chromatin. The most well studied posttranslational modification of histones is the acetylation of epsilon-amino groups on conserved lysine residues in the histones' amino-terminal tail domains. Significant advances have been made in the past few years toward the identification of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases. Currently, there are over a dozen cloned histone acetyltransferases and at least eight cloned human histone deacetylases. Interestingly, many histone deacetylases can function as transcriptional corepressors and, often, they are present in multi-subunit complexes. More intriguing, at least some histone deacetylases are associated with chromatin-remodeling machines. In addition, several studies have pointed to the possible involvement of histone deacetylases in human cancer. The availability of the cloned histone deacetylase genes has provided swift progress in the understanding of the mechanisms of deacetylases, their role in transcription, and their possible role in health and disease.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The most well studied posttranslational modification of histones is the acetylation of epsilon-amino groups on conserved lysine residues in the histones' amino-terminal tail domains.\"]}"}]}

Transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes occurs within a chromatin setting and is strongly influenced by nucleosomal barriers imposed by histone proteins. Among the well-known covalent modifications of histones, the reversible acetylation of internal lysine residues in histone amino-terminal domains has long been positively linked to transcriptional activation. Recent biochemical and genetic studies have identified several large, multisubunit enzyme complexes responsible for bringing about the targeted acetylation of histones and other factors. This review discusses our current understanding of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or acetyltransferases (ATs): their discovery, substrate specificity, catalytic mechanism, regulation, and functional links to transcription, as well as to other chromatin-modifying activities. Recent studies underscore unexpected connections to both cellular regulatory processes underlying normal development and differentiation, as well as abnormal processes that lead to oncogenesis. Although the functions of HATs and the mechanisms by which they are regulated are only beginning to be understood, these fundamental processes are likely to have far-reaching implications for human biology and disease.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Among the well-known covalent modifications of histones, the reversible acetylation of internal lysine residues in histone amino-terminal domains has long been positively linked to transcriptional activation.\"]}"}]}

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are commonly used to modify protein function. Modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation and methylation can influence the conformation of the modified protein and its interaction with other proteins or DNA. In the case of histones, PTMs on specific residues can influence chromatin structure and function by modifying the biochemical properties of key amino acids. Histone methylation events, especially on arginine- and lysine-residues, are among the best-characterized PTMs, and many of these modifications have been linked to downstream effects. The addition of a methyl group to either residue results in a slight increase in hydrophobicity, in the loss of a potential hydrogen-bond donor site and, in the alteration of the protein interaction surface. Thus far, a number of protein domains have been demonstrated to directly bind to methylated lysine residues. However, the biochemical mechanisms linking histone arginine methylation to downstream biological outputs remain poorly characterized. This review will focus on the role of histone arginine methylation in transcriptional regulation and on the crosstalk between arginine methylation and other PTMs. We will discuss the mechanisms by which differentially methylated arginines on histones modulate transcriptional outcomes and contribute to the complexity of the 'histone code'.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Histone methylation events, especially on arginine- and lysine-residues, are among the best-characterized PTMs, and many of these modifications have been linked to downstream effects.\"]}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group.

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

This report details the case of a patient with a large vascular past history, presenting a scarce association of disease: a ruptured infected aneurysm of the abdominal aorta with a spondylodiscitis due to Gemella haemolysans. The patient recovered quickly and durably, thanks to an unusual cooperation of both vascular surgeons and orthopedists: He underwent an in situ graft replacement and a front vertebral fixation in a single-step surgery. Good immediate and midterm outcome shows a new way of treatment in this rare but severe situation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

We developed a stable, sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on the synthesis of a new sol-gel material with the ion-exchange capacity sol-gel to coimmobilize the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and enzyme. The partial sulfonated (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane sol-gel (PSSG) film acted as both an ion exchanger for the immobilization of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and a matrix to immobilize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs).

Recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) (Ruconest(\u00ae), Pharming) is a new drug developed for the relief of symptoms occurring in patients with angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency. Pertinent results have already been published elsewhere; this article summarizes the progress made since then. Similar to the purified C1-inhibitor derived from human plasma, the therapeutic efficacy of rhC1INH results from its ability to block the actions of enzymes belonging to the overactivated bradykinin-forming pathway, at multiple locations. During clinical trials into the management of acute edema, a total of 190 subjects received recombinant C1-inhibitor by intravenous infusion on 714 occasions altogether. Dose-ranging efficacy studies established 50 U/kg as the recommended dose, and demonstrated the effectiveness of this agent in all localizations of hereditary angioedema attacks. Studies into the safety of rhC1INH based on 300 administrations to healthy subjects or hereditary angioedema patients followed-up for 90 days have not detected the formation of autoantibodies against rhC1INH or IgE antibodies directed against rabbit proteins, even after repeated administration on multiple occasions. These findings met favorable appraisal by the EMA, which granted European marketing authorization for rhC1INH. Pharming is expected to file a biological licence with the US FDA by the end of 2010 to obtain marketing approval in the USA. The launch of rhC1INH onto the pharmaceutical market may represent an important progress in the management of hereditary angioedema patients.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) (Ruconest(\\u00c2\\u00ae), Pharming) is a new drug developed for the relief of symptoms occurring in patients with angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency.\"]}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Initiatives were implemented by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and patient organizations to reduce time to diagnosis. We conducted a follow-up study in a surveillance cohort born after January 1, 2000 to determine whether there has been an improvement in time to diagnosis. We assessed the age of diagnosis among males with DMD born from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2015 using data collected by six US MD STARnet surveillance sites (Colorado, Iowa, western New York State, the Piedmont region of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Utah). The analytic cohort included 221 males with definite or probable DMD diagnosis without a documented family history. We computed frequency count and percentage for categorical variables, and mean, median, and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables.

Twenty-two patients with confirmed diagnosis of DMD were interviewed at two Neurology Centers (Mexican Social Security Institute) in Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico. Two forms of onset of DMD: Retarded development and locomotion problems were found, confirming other studies. The mean age of onset of symptoms for 22 patients was 2.4 years.

The serum Creatine Kinase was increased in all patients and in the early stages these levels were much higher than late stages. Family physicians have opportunities to make early diagnosis of DMD if they are aware of the two forms of onset of the disease: Retarded development and locomotion problems and of the changes in serum CK levels.

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The human cytokine erythropoietin conveys neuroprotection in animal models but has shown ambiguous results in phase 2 clinical trials in patients with optic neuritis. We assessed the safety and efficacy of erythropoietin in patients with optic neuritis as a clinically isolated syndrome in a multicentre, prospective, randomised clinical trial. This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 3 trial, conducted at 12 tertiary referral centres in Germany, included participants aged 18-50 years, within 10 days of onset of unilateral optic neuritis, with visual acuity of 0\u00b75 or less, and without a previous diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 33\u2008000 IU erythropoietin or placebo intravenously for 3 days as an adjunct to high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1000 mg per day). Block randomisation was performed by the trial statistician using an SAS code that generated randomly varying block sizes, stratified by study site and distributed using sealed envelopes. All trial participants and all study staff were masked to treatment assignment, except the trial pharmacist. The first primary outcome was atrophy of the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL), measured by optic coherence tomography (OCT) as the difference in pRNFL thickness between the affected eye at week 26 and the unaffected eye at baseline. The second primary outcome was low contrast letter acuity at week 26, measured as the 2\u00b75% Sloan chart score of the affected eye. Analysis was performed in the full analysis set of all randomised participants for whom treatment was started and at least one follow-up OCT measurement was available. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of the trial medication. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01962571. 108 participants were enrolled between Nov 25, 2014, and Oct 9, 2017, of whom 55 were assigned to erythropoietin and 53 to placebo. Five patients were excluded from the primary analysis due to not receiving the allocated medication, withdrawn consent, revised diagnosis, or loss to follow-up, yielding a full analysis set of 52 patients in the erythropoietin group and 51 in the placebo group. Mean pRNFL atrophy was 15\u00b793 \u03bcm (SD 14\u00b791) in the erythropoietin group and 14\u00b765 \u03bcm (15\u00b760) in the placebo group (adjusted mean treatment difference 1\u00b702 \u03bcm; 95% CI -5\u00b751 to 7\u00b755; p=0\u00b776). Mean low contrast letter acuity scores were 49\u00b760 (21\u00b731) in the erythropoietin group and 49\u00b706 (21\u00b793) in the placebo group (adjusted mean treatment difference -4\u00b703; -13\u00b706 to 5\u00b701). Adverse events occurred in 43 (81%) participants in the erythropoietin group and in 42 (81%) in the placebo group. The most common adverse event was headache, occuring in 15 (28%) patients in the erythropoietin group and 13 (25%) patients in the placebo group. Serious adverse events occurred in eight (15%) participants in the erythropoietin and in four (8%) in the placebo group. One patient (2%) in the erythropoietin group developed a venous sinus thrombosis, which was treated with anticoagulants and resolved without sequelae. Erythropoietin as an adjunct to corticosteroids conveyed neither functional nor structural neuroprotection in the visual pathways after optic neuritis. Future research could focus on modified erythropoietin administration, assess its efficacy independent of corticosteroids, and investigate whether it affects the conversion of optic neuritis to multiple sclerosis.

The current definition of the pattern of liver injury in hepatotoxicity (DILI) is given by the R (ratio) value, dividing alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in upper limits of normal at DILI onset. We aimed to explore the validity of using aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) as biomarkers of hepatocelullar and cholestatic damage, respectively, when calculating the R value. Clinical, laboratory and histological data from 588 DILI episodes included in the Spanish DILI Registry were analyzed. Linear regression analysis was performed to establish the most appropriate cut-off points for hepatocellular and cholestatic patterns when calculating R with AST and GGT. The overall agreement between ALT/ALP and AST/ALP was 76%, with 96%, 61% and 41% agreement in the hepatocellular (R\u00a0\u2265\u00a05), cholestatic (R\u00a0\u2264\u00a02) and mixed groups respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Classified by the causative drug, the agreement was higher (87-95%) among drug classes that mainly present with hepatocellular damage and lower (48-58%) for those in which cholestatic-mixed injury predominate (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001)). The overall agreement between ALT/ALP and ALT/GGT was weak (59%), except for in hepatocellular cases that showed a good agreement (94%) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Pattern of injury according to liver histology demonstrated 65%, 68% and 47% agreement for ALT/ALP, AST/ALP and ALT/GGT ratios respectively.

Hy's Law, which states that hepatocellular drug-induced liver injury (DILI) with jaundice indicates a serious reaction, is used widely to determine risk for acute liver failure (ALF). We aimed to optimize the definition of Hy's Law and to develop a model for predicting ALF in patients with DILI. We collected data from 771 patients with DILI (805 episodes) from the Spanish DILI registry, from April 1994 through August 2012. We analyzed data collected at DILI recognition and at the time of peak levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin (TBL). Of the 771 patients with DILI, 32 developed ALF. Hepatocellular injury, female sex, high levels of TBL, and a high ratio of aspartate aminotransferase (AST):ALT were independent risk factors for ALF. We compared 3 ways to use Hy's Law to predict which patients would develop ALF; all included TBL greater than 2-fold the upper limit of normal (\u00d7ULN) and either ALT\u00a0level greater than 3\u00a0\u00d7 ULN, a ratio (R) value (ALT\u00a0\u00d7 ULN/alkaline phosphatase\u00a0\u00d7 ULN) of 5 or greater, or a new ratio (nR) value (ALT or AST, whichever produced the highest\u00a0\u00d7ULN/ alkaline phosphatase\u00a0\u00d7 ULN value) of 5 or greater. At recognition of DILI, the R- and nR-based models identified patients who developed ALF with 67% and 63% specificity, respectively, whereas use of only ALT level identified them with 44% specificity. However, the level of ALT and the nR model each identified patients who developed ALF with 90% sensitivity, whereas the R criteria identified them with 83% sensitivity. An equal number of patients who did and did not develop ALF had alkaline phosphatase levels greater than 2\u00a0\u00d7 ULN. An algorithm based on AST level greater than 17.3\u00a0\u00d7 ULN, TBL greater than 6.6\u00a0\u00d7 ULN, and AST:ALT greater than 1.5 identified patients who developed ALF with 82% specificity and 80% sensitivity.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant.

While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Omicron appears to lead to a milder illness for patients compared with previous COVID-19 variants. However, not all infected with Omicron would describe their illness as mild. In this study, we investigate the experienced severity and symptoms of the Omicron variant. We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study, including 5036 individuals of all ages, consisting of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases from 1 January to 31 January 2022 (n\u00a0=\u00a04506) and a control group without SARS-COV-2 infection in December 2021 or January 2022 (n\u00a0=\u00a0530). Omicron was dominant during this period. Cases were asked about their acute symptoms and answered a web-based questionnaire 10-30 days after their positive test while controls were asked about symptoms during the past week. Among cases, 97% reported at least one symptom during the acute phase compared with 79% of controls. Just over half the cases assessed their illness as asymptomatic or mild, whereas 46% assessed their illness as moderate or severe. Children reported fewer symptoms and less severe illnesses than adults (P <0.001). The largest risk differences (RDs) between adult cases and controls due to symptoms were observed for fever (RD\u00a0=\u00a060.6%, confidence interval [CI] 57.4-63.6), fatigue (RD\u00a0=\u00a049.6%, CI 44.1-54.7), and chills (RD\u00a0=\u00a048.8%, CI 43.8-53.2). Most of those infected with Omicron experience symptoms, and the Omicron variant appears to lead to less severe disease. However, this does not mean that all the infected experience an Omicron infection as mild. The unprecedented rate of Omicron infections worldwide leads to urgent questions about the rate of long COVID after Omicron infections.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Omicron appears to lead to a milder illness for patients compared with previous COVID-19 variants.\", \"Most of those infected with Omicron experience symptoms, and the Omicron variant appears to lead to less severe disease.

Patients with hematologic disease are at high risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 due to disease-inherent and therapy-related immunodeficiency. Whether infection with the SARS-CoV2 omicron variant leads to attenuated disease severity in these patients is currently unknown. We assessed clinical and laboratory parameters in 61 patients with underlying hematologic conditions with a SARS-CoV2 omicron variant infection confirmed by nucleic acid amplification testing. Fifty patients reported symptoms of COVID-19, most commonly fatigue (37 patients, 60.66%) and cough (32 patients, 52.46%). 39.34% of patients reported fever. Dyspnea was reported by 10 patients and 7 patients (11.48%) required oxygen therapy. Anosmia and ageusia were relatively rare, occurring in less than 10% of patients. Severity of SARS-CoV2 infection could be assessed in 60 patients. Five cases of critical illness leading to ICU admission occurred during the observation period. Overall mortality was 9.84% in this patient cohort, with heterogeneous causes of death. The majority of omicron-infected hematologic patients experienced mild symptoms or remained asymptomatic. In this study, symptoms of COVID-19 tended to be milder than described for previous SARS-CoV2 variants. However, the extent to which attenuated severity of omicron-variant SARS-CoV2 infection is caused by altered viral pathogenicity or pre-existing host immunity cannot be inferred from our data and should be investigated in larger prospective studies.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"In this study, symptoms of COVID-19 tended to be milder than described for previous SARS-CoV2 variants.\"]}"}]}

Since its emergence in November, 2021, in southern Africa, the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant of concern (VOC) has rapidly spread across the world. We aimed to investigate the severity of omicron and the extent to which booster vaccines are effective in preventing symptomatic infection. In this study, using the Scotland-wide Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) platform, we did a cohort analysis with a nested test-negative design incident case-control study covering the period Nov 1-Dec 19, 2021, to provide initial estimates of omicron severity and the effectiveness of vaccine boosters against symptomatic disease relative to 25 weeks or more after the second vaccine dose. Primary care data derived from 940 general practices across Scotland were linked to laboratory data and hospital admission data. We compared outcomes between infection with the delta VOC (defined as S-gene positive) and the omicron VOC (defined as S-gene negative). We assessed effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, with infection confirmed through a positive RT-PCR. By Dec 19, 2021, there were 23\u2008840 S-gene-negative cases in Scotland, which were predominantly among those aged 20-39 years (11\u2008732 [49\u00b72%]). The proportion of S-gene-negative cases that were possible reinfections was more than ten times that of S-gene-positive cases (7\u00b76% vs 0\u00b77%; p<0\u00b70001). There were 15 hospital admissions in S-gene-negative individuals, giving an adjusted observed-to-expected admissions ratio of 0\u00b732 (95% CI 0\u00b719-0\u00b752). The booster vaccine dose was associated with a 57% (54-60) reduction in the risk of symptomatic S-gene-negative infection relative to individuals who tested positive 25 weeks or more after the second vaccine dose. These early national data suggest that omicron is associated with a two-thirds reduction in the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation compared with delta. Although offering the greatest protection against delta, the booster dose of vaccination offers substantial additional protection against the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 for omicron compared with 25 weeks or more after the second vaccine dose.

Globally, SARS CoV-2 omicron variant has led to a notable increase of COVID-19 diagnoses, although with less severe clinical manifestations and decreased hospitalizations. The omicron wave swelled faster than previous waves, completely displacing the delta variant within weeks, and creating worldwide concern about final, successful pandemic control. Some authors contend that symptoms associated to omicron differ from 'traditional' symptoms and more closely resemble those of the common cold. One major COVID-19 symptom frequent with other variants-loss of taste and smell-is rarely present with omicron. This may be of interest, since it has also been suggested that direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion into the brainstem through the olfactory nerves by transsynaptic pathways could provide one explanation for the acute respiratory distress syndrome refractory to treatment. Brainstem infection by SARS-CoV-2 can severely damage the respiratory center, triggering functional deviations that affect involuntary respiration, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome refractory to treatment, the main cause of death in COVID-19 patients. A shift in the omicron SARS-CoV-2 entry pathway from cell-surface fusion, triggered by TMPRSS2, to cathepsin-dependent fusion within the endosome, may affect transmission, cellular tropism and pathogenesis. Therefore, we can hypothesize that this entrance modification may impact transmission from the olfactory nerve to the brainstem through transsynaptic pathways. A decrement of the virus's direct invasion into the brainstem could diminish respiratory center dysfunction, reducing acute respiratory distress syndrome and the need for mechanical ventilation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Globally, SARS CoV-2 omicron variant has led to a notable increase of COVID-19 diagnoses, although with less severe clinical manifestations and decreased hospitalizations.\"]}"}]}

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still ongoing, with no signs of abatement in sight. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative agent of this pandemic and has claimed over 5 million lives, is still mutating, resulting in numerous variants. One of the newest variants is Omicron, which shows an increase in its transmissibility, but also reportedly reduces hospitalization rates and shows milder symptoms, such as in those who have been vaccinated. As a result, many believe that Omicron provides a natural vaccination, which is the first step toward ending the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on published research and scientific evidence, we review and discuss how the end of this pandemic is predicted to occur as a result of Omicron variants being surpassed in the community. In light of the findings of our research, we believe that it is most likely true that the Omicron variant is a natural way of vaccinating the masses and slowing the spread of this deadly pandemic. While the mutation that causes the Omicron variant is encouraging, subsequent mutations do not guarantee that the disease it causes will be less severe. As the virus continues to evolve, humans must constantly adapt by increasing their immunity through vaccination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"One of the newest variants is Omicron, which shows an increase in its transmissibility, but also reportedly reduces hospitalization rates and shows milder symptoms, such as in those who have been vaccinated.\"]}"}]}

The Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant is rapidly spreading in the US since December 2021 and is more contagious than earlier variants. Currently, data on the severity of the disease caused by the Omicron variant compared with the Delta variant is limited. Here we compared 3-day risks of emergency department (ED) visit, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation in patients who were first infected during a time period when the Omicron variant was emerging to those in patients who were first infected when the Delta variant was predominant. This is a retrospective cohort study of electronic health record (EHR) data of 577,938 first-time SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from a multicenter, nationwide database in the US during 9/1/2021-12/24/2021, including 14,054 who had their first infection during the 12/15/2021-12/24/2021 period when the Omicron variant emerged (\"Emergent Omicron cohort\") and 563,884 who had their first infection during the 9/1/2021-12/15/2021 period when the Delta variant was predominant (\"Delta cohort\"). After propensity-score matching the cohorts, the 3-day risks of four outcomes (ED visit, hospitalization, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation) were compared. Risk ratios, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Of 14,054 patients in the Emergent Omicron cohort (average age, 36.4 \u00b1 24.3 years), 27.7% were pediatric patients (<18 years old), 55.4% female, 1.8% Asian, 17.1% Black, 4.8% Hispanic, and 57.3% White. The Emergent Omicron cohort differed significantly from the Delta cohort in demographics, comorbidities, and socio-economic determinants of health. After propensity-score matching for demographics, socio-economic determinants of health, comorbidities, medications and vaccination status, the 3-day risks in the Emergent Omicron cohort outcomes were consistently less than half those in the Delta cohort: ED visit: 4.55% vs. 15.22% (risk ratio or RR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.28-0.33); hospitalization: 1.75% vs. 3.95% (RR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.38-0.52]); ICU admission: 0.26% vs. 0.78% (RR: 0.33, 95% CI:0.23-0.48); mechanical ventilation: 0.07% vs. 0.43% (RR: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.08-0.32). In children under 5 years old, the overall risks of ED visits and hospitalization in the Emergent Omicron cohort were 3.89% and 0.96% respectively, significantly lower than 21.01% and 2.65% in the matched Delta cohort (RR for ED visit: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.14-0.25; RR for hospitalization: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.19-0.68). Similar trends were observed for other pediatric age groups (5-11, 12-17 years), adults (18-64 years) and older adults (\u2265 65 years).

The omicron variant (B.1.1.529) of SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated partial vaccine escape and high transmissibility, with early studies indicating lower severity of infection than that of the delta variant (B.1.617.2). We aimed to better characterise omicron severity relative to delta by assessing the relative risk of hospital attendance, hospital admission, or death in a large national cohort. Individual-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases resident in England between Nov 29, 2021, and Jan 9, 2022, were linked to routine datasets on vaccination status, hospital attendance and admission, and mortality. The relative risk of hospital attendance or admission within 14 days, or death within 28 days after confirmed infection, was estimated using proportional hazards regression. Analyses were stratified by test date, 10-year age band, ethnicity, residential region, and vaccination status, and were further adjusted for sex, index of multiple deprivation decile, evidence of a previous infection, and year of age within each age band. A secondary analysis estimated variant-specific and vaccine-specific vaccine effectiveness and the intrinsic relative severity of omicron infection compared with delta (ie, the relative risk in unvaccinated cases). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of hospital attendance (not necessarily resulting in admission) with omicron compared with delta was 0\u00b756 (95% CI 0\u00b754-0\u00b758); for hospital admission and death, HR estimates were 0\u00b741 (0\u00b739-0\u00b743) and 0\u00b731 (0\u00b726-0\u00b737), respectively. Omicron versus delta HR estimates varied with age for all endpoints examined. The adjusted HR for hospital admission was 1\u00b710 (0\u00b785-1\u00b742) in those younger than 10 years, decreasing to 0\u00b725 (0\u00b721-0\u00b730) in 60-69-year-olds, and then increasing to 0\u00b747 (0\u00b740-0\u00b756) in those aged at least 80 years. For both variants, past infection gave some protection against death both in vaccinated (HR 0\u00b747 [0\u00b732-0\u00b768]) and unvaccinated (0\u00b718 [0\u00b706-0\u00b757]) cases. In vaccinated cases, past infection offered no additional protection against hospital admission beyond that provided by vaccination (HR 0\u00b796 [0\u00b788-1\u00b704]); however, for unvaccinated cases, past infection gave moderate protection (HR 0\u00b755 [0\u00b748-0\u00b763]). Omicron versus delta HR estimates were lower for hospital admission (0\u00b730 [0\u00b728-0\u00b732]) in unvaccinated cases than the corresponding HR estimated for all cases in the primary analysis. Booster vaccination with an mRNA vaccine was highly protective against hospitalisation and death in omicron cases (HR for hospital admission 8-11 weeks post-booster vs unvaccinated: 0\u00b722 [0\u00b720-0\u00b724]), with the protection afforded after a booster not being affected by the vaccine used for doses 1 and 2. The risk of severe outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection is substantially lower for omicron than for delta, with higher reductions for more severe endpoints and significant variation with age. Underlying the observed risks is a larger reduction in intrinsic severity (in unvaccinated individuals) counterbalanced by a reduction in vaccine effectiveness. Documented previous SARS-CoV-2 infection offered some protection against hospitalisation and high protection against death in unvaccinated individuals, but only offered additional protection in vaccinated individuals for the death endpoint. Booster vaccination with mRNA vaccines maintains over 70% protection against hospitalisation and death in breakthrough confirmed omicron infections.

The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) is estimated to be more transmissible than previous strains of SARS-CoV-2 especially among children, potentially resulting in croup which is a characteristic disease in children. Current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases among children might be higher because (i) school-aged children have higher contact rates and (ii) the COVID-19 vaccination strategy prioritizes the elderly in most countries. However, there have been no reports confirming the age-varying susceptibility to the Omicron variant to date. We developed an age-structured compartmental model, combining age-specific contact matrix in South Korea and observed distribution of periods between each stage of infection in the national epidemiological investigation. A Bayesian inference method was used to estimate the age-specific force of infection and, accordingly, age-specific susceptibility, given epidemic data during the third (pre-Delta), fourth (Delta driven), and fifth (Omicron driven) waves in South Korea. As vaccine uptake increased, individuals who were vaccinated were excluded from the susceptible population in accordance with vaccine effectiveness against the Delta and Omicron variants, respectively. A significant difference between the age-specific susceptibility to the Omicron and that to the pre-Omicron variants was found in the younger age group. The rise in susceptibility to the Omicron/pre-Delta variant was highest in the 10-15 years age group (5.28 times [95% CI, 4.94-5.60]), and the rise in susceptibility to the Omicron/Delta variant was highest in the 15-19 years age group (3.21 times [95% CI, 3.12-3.31]), whereas in those aged 50 years or more, the susceptibility to the Omicron/pre-Omicron remained stable at approximately twofold.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron is considered to be less severe than infection with variant Delta, with rarer occurrence of severe disease requiring intensive care. Little information is available on comorbid factors, clinical conditions and specific viral mutational patterns associated with the severity of variant Omicron infection. In this multicenter prospective cohort study, patients consecutively admitted for severe COVID-19 in 20 intensive care units in France between December 7th 2021 and May 1st 2022 were included. Among 259 patients, we show that the clinical phenotype of patients infected with variant Omicron (n\u2009=\u2009148) is different from that in those infected with variant Delta (n\u2009=\u2009111). We observe no significant relationship between Delta and Omicron variant lineages/sublineages and 28-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]\u2009=\u20090.68 [0.35-1.32]; p\u2009=\u20090.253). Among Omicron-infected patients, 43.2% are immunocompromised, most of whom have received two doses of vaccine or more (85.9%) but display a poor humoral response to vaccination. The mortality rate of immunocompromised patients infected with variant Omicron is significantly higher than that of non-immunocompromised patients (46.9% vs 26.2%; p\u2009=\u20090.009).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemics. Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant is the cause for the surge of the COVID-19 pandemics of the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, although its subvariants are responsible for the following daily increase of COVID-19 cases in July 2022. Early reports of Omicron variant confirmed patients indicated less severe disease course compared with the disease caused by previously encountered variants with absence of data regarding cardiac involvement by Omicron. A 42-year-old male who tested positive for Omicron was admitted on January 2022 with chest pain and ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads. Coronary angiography revealed non-significant coronary artery disease. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated features consistent with myocarditis with involvement of 22% of the left ventricular mass by late gadolinium enhancement involving both the lateral and the septal walls. The second patient is a 60-year-old male presented following syncope and palpitations after he was confirmed with Omicron infection. Upon emergency department arrival he had ventricular tachycardia of 250 beats/minute and underwent urgent cardioversion. During his hospitalization, there was no recurrence of malignant arrhythmia, coronary angiography revealed non-obstructive disease. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated imaging features suggesting acute myocarditis with involvement of 19% of the left ventricular mass. This is the first report of myocarditis cases as a possible complication associated with Omicron variant. Despite preliminary reports of less severe disease clinicians should be vigilant for potential deleterious cardiac complications of Omicron.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Early reports of Omicron variant confirmed patients indicated less severe disease course compared with the disease caused by previously encountered variants with absence of data regarding cardiac involvement by Omicron\"]}"}]}

Omicron, the new Covid-19 variant, has already become dominant in many countries and is spreading at an unprecedented speed. The objective of this study was to review the existing literature on Omicron's transmissibility, immune evasion, reinfection, and severity.A literature search was performed using \"PubMed,\" \"Web of Science,\" \"Scopus,\" \"ScienceDirect,\" \"Google Scholar,\" \"medRxiv,\" and \"bioRxiv.\" Data were extracted from articles that reported at least one of the following: transmissibility, immune evasion, reinfection, and severity related to Omicron.We found that Omicron spread faster than any other variant. This higher transmissibility can be ascribed to its extraordinary ability to evade the immunity developed by both vaccination and previous infections. However, we found that infections by Omicron were significantly less severe than those caused by Delta and other previous variants. We observed a significantly lower incidence of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mechanical ventilator use in Omicron infections than in Delta or other variants. A substantially shorter median hospital stay and lower fatality rate were also observed in the Omicron infections. Despite Omicron's higher potential to evade immunity, vaccines and booster shots were found to be still significantly effective in protecting against severe Covid-19 infections.Omicrons may be less severe than other variants of concern. However, its immune evasiveness and rapid spread pose an enormous threat to the global healthcare system.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"However, we found that infections by Omicron were significantly less severe than those caused by Delta and other previous variants.\"]}"}]}

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection from the Omicron variant in children/adolescents is less severe than infection from the Delta variant. Those 6 to <18 years also have less severe disease than those <6 years old. There are limited data assessing coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease severity in children/adolescents infected with the Omicron variant. We identified children and adolescents <18 years of age with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with Delta and propensity score-matched controls with Omicron variant infection from the National COVID-19 Database in Qatar. Primary outcome was disease severity, determined by hospital admission, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), or mechanical ventilation within 14 days of diagnosis, or death within 28 days. Among 1735 cases with Delta variant infection between 1 June and 6 November 2021, and 32\u2009635 cases with Omicron variant infection between 1 January and 15 January 2022, who did not have prior infection and were not vaccinated, we identified 985 propensity score-matched pairs. Among those who were Delta infected, 84.2% had mild, 15.7% had moderate, and 0.1% had severe/critical disease. Among those who were Omicron infected, 97.8% had mild, 2.2% had moderate, and none had severe/critical disease (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Omicron variant infection (vs Delta) was associated with significantly lower odds of moderate or severe/critical disease (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], .07-.18).

Understanding the disease severity associated with the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is important in determining appropriate management strategies at the individual and population levels. We determined the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in persons infected with the Omicron vs the Delta variant. We identified individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection with Delta and propensity-score matched controls with Omicron variant infection from the National COVID-19 Database in Qatar. We excluded temporary visitors to Qatar, those with a prior documented infection, those \u226418 years old, and those with <14 days of follow up after the index test positive date. We determined the rates of admission to the hospital, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death among those infected with the Delta or Omicron variants. Among 9763 cases infected with the Delta variant and 11\u2009310 cases infected with the Omicron variant, we identified 3926 propensity-score matched pairs. Among 3926 Delta infected, 3259 (83.0%) had mild, 633 (16.1%) had moderate and 34 (0.9%) had severe/critical disease.

Illness after infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant is less severe compared with previous variants. Data on the disease burden in immunocompromised patients are lacking. We investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of immunocompromised patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Omicron. Organ transplant recipients, patients on anti-CD20 therapy, and allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients infected with the Omicron variant were included. Characteristics of consenting patients were collected and patients were contacted regularly until symptom resolution. To identify possible risk factors for hospitalization, a univariate logistic analysis was performed. 114 consecutive immunocompromised patients were enrolled. Eighty-nine percent had previously received 3 mRNA vaccinations. While only 1 patient died, 23 (20%) were hospitalized for a median of 11 days. A low SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody response (<300 BAU [binding antibody units]/mL) at diagnosis, being older, being a lung transplant recipient, having more comorbidities, and having a higher frailty score were associated with hospital admission (all P < .01). At the end of follow-up, 25% had still not fully recovered. Of the 23 hospitalized patients, 70% had a negative and 92% had a low IgG (<300 BAU/mL) antibody response at admission. Sotrovimab was administered to 17 of these patients, and 1 died. While the mortality in immunocompromised patients infected with Omicron was low, hospital admission was frequent and the duration of symptoms often prolonged. In addition to vaccination, other interventions are needed to limit the morbidity from COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"In the general population, illness after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is less severe compared with previous variants.\"]}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity. The correlation found between these two lipid mediators indicating a link between oxidative stress and airway inflammation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease that causes episodic attacks of subcutaneous and submucosal edema, which can be painful, incapacitating, and potentially fatal. These attacks are mediated by excessive bradykinin production, as a result of uncontrolled activation of the plasma kallikrein/kinin system, which is caused by a C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction in HAE types 1 and 2, respectively. For many years, treatment options were limited to therapies with substantial adverse effects, insufficient efficacy, or difficult routes of administration. Increased insights in the pathophysiology of HAE have paved the way for the development of new therapies with fewer side effects. In the last two decades, several targeted novel therapeutic strategies for HAE have been developed, for both long-term prophylaxis and on demand treatment of acute attacks. This article reviews the advances in the development of more effective and convenient treatment options for HAE and their anticipated effects on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The emergence of these improved treatment options will presumably change current HAE guidelines, but adherence to these recommendations may become restricted by high treatment costs. It will therefore be essential to determine the indications and identify the patients that will benefit most from these newest treatment generations. Ultimately, current preclinical research into gene therapies may eventually lead the way towards curative treatment options for HAE. In conclusion, an increasing shift towards the use of highly effective long-term prophylaxis is anticipated, which should drastically abate the burden on patients with hereditary angioedema.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease that causes episodic attacks of subcutaneous and submucosal edema, which can be painful, incapacitating, and potentially fatal.

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The novel morpholino antisense oligonucleotide viltolarsen targets exon 53 of the dystrophin gene, and could be an effective treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We investigated viltolarsen's ability to induce dystrophin expression and examined its safety in DMD patients. In this open-label, multicenter, parallel-group, phase 1/2, exploratory study, 16 ambulant and nonambulant males aged 5-12\u00a0years with DMD received viltolarsen 40 or 80\u00a0mg/kg/week via intravenous infusion for 24\u00a0weeks. Primary endpoints were dystrophin expression and exon 53 skipping levels. In western blot analysis, mean changes in dystrophin expression (% normal) from baseline to Weeks 12 and 24 were\u00a0-\u00a01.21 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.5136) and 1.46 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.1636), respectively, in the 40\u00a0mg/kg group, and 0.76 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.2367) and 4.81 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0536), respectively, in the 80\u00a0mg/kg group. The increase in mean dystrophin level at Weeks 12 and 24 was significant in the 80\u00a0mg/kg group (2.78%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.0364). Patients receiving 80\u00a0mg/kg showed a higher mean exon 53 skipping level (42.4%) than those receiving 40\u00a0mg/kg (21.8%). All adverse events were judged to be mild or moderate in intensity and none led to study discontinuation. Treatment with viltolarsen 40 or 80\u00a0mg/kg elicited an increasing trend in dystrophin expression and exon 53 skipping levels, and was safe and well tolerated. The decline in motor function appeared less marked in patients with higher dystrophin levels; this may warrant further investigation. This study supports the potential clinical benefit of viltolarsen.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"OBJECTIVE: The novel morpholino antisense oligonucleotide viltolarsen targets exon 53 of the dystrophin gene, and could be an effective treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystr\"]}"}]}

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a degenerative muscle disease that causes progressive loss of muscle mass, leading to premature death. The mutations often cause a distorted reading frame and premature stop codons, resulting in an almost total lack of dystrophin protein. The reading frame can be corrected using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) that induce exon skipping. The morpholino AON viltolarsen (code name: NS-065/NCNP-01) has been shown to induce exon 53 skipping, restoring the reading frame for patients with exon 52 deletions. We recently administered NS-065/NCNP-01 intravenously to DMD patients in an exploratory investigator-initiated, first-in-human trial of NS-065/NCNP-01. In this methods article, we present the molecular characterization of dystrophin expression using Sanger sequencing, RT-PCR, and western blotting in the clinical trial.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of a non-selective retinoid X receptor agonist in promoting remyelination in people with multiple sclerosis. This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2a trial (CCMR One) recruited patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis from two centres in the UK. Eligible participants were aged 18-50 years and had been receiving dimethyl fumarate for at least 6 months. Via a web-based system run by an independent statistician, participants were randomly assigned (1:1), by probability-weighted minimisation using four binary factors, to receive 300 mg/m Between Jan 17, 2017, and May 17, 2019, 52 participants were randomly assigned to receive either bexarotene (n=26) or placebo (n=26). Participants who received bexarotene had a higher mean number of adverse events (6\u00b712 [SD 3\u00b709]; 159 events in total) than did participants who received placebo (1\u00b763 [SD 1\u00b750]; 39 events in total).

To assess the opposing effects of enhanced erythropoiesis due to anemia and iron overloading on hepcidin in \u03b2-TM patients. This prospective observational study was done at our tertiary care hospital. Eighty-three pediatric polytransfused (> 20 transfusions) patients of \u03b2-TM were compared with 70 children who served as controls. Serum assays for ferritin, transferrin receptors (sTfR) and hepcidin were performed. Independent Student t test was used to compare variables between both the groups. A Pearson correlation coefficient was used to find any correlation between ferritin, sTfR and hepcidin. The mean value of hepcidin in \u03b2-TM children was 13.88\u00b110.68 ng/ml (range, 0.9-60 ng/ml) and showed significant negative correlation with sTfR (r = -0.296, P < 0.0066). However, there was no correlation of hepcidin with ferritin. Ferritin and sTfR were significantly elevated in \u03b2-TM children compared to controls (P < 0.001). The mean serum hepcidin/ferritin index in the study group (0.00552) was significantly lower (P value < 0.001) than the controls (0.378) thus indicating inappropriate levels of hepcidin to iron overload.

Iron is an essential nutrient, but its concentration and distribution in the body must be tightly controlled due to its inherent toxicity and insolubility in aqueous solution. Living systems have successfully overcome these potential limitations by evolving a range of iron binding proteins and transport systems that effectively maintain iron in a nontoxic and soluble form for much, if not all, of its time within the body. In the circulation, iron is transported to target organs bound to the serum iron binding protein transferrin. Individual cells modulate their uptake of transferrin-bound iron depending on their iron requirements, using both transferrin receptor 1-dependent and independent pathways. Once inside the cell, iron can be chaperoned to sites of need or, if in excess, stored within ferritin. Iron is released from cells by the iron export protein ferroportin1, which requires the ferroxidase activity of ceruloplasmin or hephestin to load iron safely onto transferrin. The regulation of iron export is controlled predominantly at the systemic level by the master regulator of iron homeostasis hepcidin. Hepcidin, in turn, responds to changes in body iron demand, making use of a range of regulatory mechanisms that center on the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the field of iron metabolism and outlines the key components of the iron transport and regulation systems.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The regulation of iron export is controlled predominantly at the systemic level by the master regulator of iron homeostasis hepcidin.

Iron homeostasis ensures adequate iron for biological processes while preventing excessive iron accumulation, which can lead to tissue injury. In mammalian systems, iron availability is controlled by the interaction of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin with ferroportin, a molecule that functions both as the hepcidin receptor as well as the sole known cellular exporter of iron. By reducing iron export through ferroportin to blood plasma, hepcidin inhibits the mobilization of iron from stores and the absorption of dietary iron. Among the many processes requiring iron, erythropoiesis is the most iron-intensive, consuming most iron circulating in blood plasma. Under conditions of enhanced erythropoiesis, more iron is required to provide developing erythroblasts with adequate iron for heme and hemoglobin synthesis. Here the hormone erythroferrone, produced by erythroblasts, acts on hepatocytes to suppress hepcidin production, and thereby increase dietary iron absorption and mobilization from stores. This review focuses on the discovery of erythroferrone and recent advances in understanding the role of this hormone in the regulation of iron homeostasis during states of increased erythropoietic demand. Gaps in our understanding of the role of erythroferrone are highlighted for future study.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"In mammalian systems, iron availability is controlled by the interaction of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin with ferroportin, a molecule that functions both as the hepcidin receptor as well as the sole known cellular exporter of iron. \", \"y reducing iron export through ferroportin to blood plasma, hepcidin inhibits the mobilization of iron from stores and the absorption of dietary iron.\"]}"}]}

Iron deficiency anemia is the most prevalent nutritional disorder in the world. Information on the metabolism of hepcidin and its possible significance as a biochemical parameter in iron deficiency anemia is reported in this review, which was based on a survey of the databases PubMed and LILACS for articles published between 2006 and 2010 on hepcidin as a biomarker for the regulation of iron metabolism. The literature search returned 35 studies published in international journals and one study on the subject in a Brazilian journal. Hepcidin production is homeostatically regulated by anemia and hypoxia. When oxygen delivery is inadequate, hepcidin levels decrease. Consequently, more iron is made available from the diet and from the storage pool in macrophages and hepatocytes. Hepcidin binds to ferroportin, regulating iron release into plasma. When hepcidin concentrations are low, ferroportin molecules are displayed on the plasma membrane and release iron. When hepcidin levels increase, hepcidin binds to ferroportin molecules inducing their internalization and degradation, and iron release is decreased progressively. Apparently, the development of diagnosis and therapy for anemia based on the bioindicator hepcidin may provide a more effective approach. Epidemiological studies are needed to demonstrate the relevance of hepcidin to the differential diagnosis of anemia, including sampling protocols for analysis, with standardization similar to that used in other biochemical assessments, and establishment of cutoff points for urinary and plasma expression of this peptide.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Information on the metabolism of hepcidin and its possible significance as a biochemical parameter in iron deficiency anemia is reported in this review, which was based on a survey of the databases PubMed and LILACS for articles published between 2006 and 2010 on hepcidin as a biomarker for the regulation of iron metabolism\"]}"}]}

Hepcidin is related to the pathogenesis of chronic renal failure anemia, which is considered a chronic inflammatory state as well as HCV infection. IL-6 stimulates the release of hepcidin from the liver, suppresses intestinal iron uptake, and releases iron from internal stores. To detect the association between IL-6 gene polymorphism and anemia markers, 80 hemodialysis (HD) patients [40 negative HCV HD patients and 40 positive HCV HD patients] were studied by routine chemistry and complete blood count, in addition to the assessment of serum hepcidin, iron parameters [serum iron and serum ferritin], and hepatitis C markers. IL-6 polymorphism -174G/C was determined by MS-PCR, while IL-6 polymorphisms -597G/A and -572 G/C were detected by PCR-SSP. Hepcidin was non-significantly elevated in HCV-positive compared with HCV-negative hemodialysis patients. A statistically significant difference was detected between the negative and positive HCV HD patients in frequencies of IL-6 -174 G/C and -597 G/A (P\u2264 0.01 and P\u2264 0.001, respectively).

Transport of iron across the placenta is critical for appropriate development of the fetus. Iron deficiency during pregnancy remains a major public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, often exacerbated by infectious diseases leading to altered iron trafficking via inflammatory responses. Herein, we investigate the role of hepcidin, a master regulator of iron homeostasis, on regulation of iron transport across trophoblast cells. We utilized the Jeg-3 choriocarcinoma cell line for analysis of the expression of transferrin receptor, ferritin, and ferroportin as well as the export of  Hepcidin treatment of Jeg-3 cells decreased the expression of ferroportin and transferrin receptor (TfR) and reduced the cellular export of iron. Lower expression of TfR on the syncytiotrophoblast was associated with the highest levels of hepcidin in maternal circulation, and ferroportin expression was positively associated with placental TfR. Placentas from small-for-gestational-age newborns had significantly lower levels of ferroportin and ferritin gene expression at delivery. Our data suggest that hepcidin plays an important role in the regulation of iron transport across the placenta, making it a critical link in movement of iron into fetal circulation. Hepcidin has a direct impact on iron transport across the human placenta. This study provides the first evidence of direct regulation of iron efflux from human trophoblast cells by hepcidin. These data extend our understanding of iron transport across the maternal-fetal interface, a process critical for fetal health and development.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Iron transport across the human placenta is regulated by hepcidin.\", \"we investigate the role of hepcidin, a master regulator of iron homeostasis, on regulation of iron transport across trophoblast cells.\"]}"}]}

The hepatic hormone hepcidin is a key regulator of systemic iron metabolism. Its expression is largely regulated by 2 signaling pathways: the \"iron-regulated\" bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and the inflammatory JAK-STAT pathways. To obtain broader insights into cellular processes that modulate hepcidin transcription and to provide a resource to identify novel genetic modifiers of systemic iron homeostasis, we designed an RNA interference (RNAi) screen that monitors hepcidin promoter activity after the knockdown of 19\u2009599 genes in hepatocarcinoma cells. Interestingly, many of the putative hepcidin activators play roles in signal transduction, inflammation, or transcription, and affect hepcidin transcription through BMP-responsive elements. Furthermore, our work sheds light on new components of the transcriptional machinery that maintain steady-state levels of hepcidin expression and its responses to the BMP- and interleukin-6-triggered signals. Notably, we discover hepcidin suppression mediated via components of Ras/RAF MAPK and mTOR signaling, linking hepcidin transcriptional control to the pathways that respond to mitogen stimulation and nutrient status. Thus using a combination of RNAi screening, reverse phase protein arrays, and small molecules testing, we identify links between the control of systemic iron homeostasis and critical liver processes such as regeneration, response to injury, carcinogenesis, and nutrient metabolism. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The hepatic hormone hepcidin is a key regulator of systemic iron metabolism.\"]}"}]}

The mechanisms of iron handling also protect cells from the deleterious effects of free iron, which can produce oxidative damage of membranes, proteins, and lipids. Over the past decade, several important molecules involved in iron homeostasis have been discovered, and their function has expanded our understanding of iron trafficking under normal and pathological conditions. Physiologic iron metabolism is strongly influenced by inflammation, which clinically leads to anemia. Although hepcidin, a small circulating peptide produced by the liver, has been found to be the key regulator of iron trafficking, molecular pathways of iron sensing that control iron metabolism and hepcidin production are still incompletely understood.

Hepcidin is a liver-made peptide proposed to be a central regulator of intestinal iron absorption and iron recycling by macrophages. In animal models, hepcidin is induced by inflammation and iron loading, but its regulation in humans has not been studied. We report that urinary excretion of hepcidin was greatly increased in patients with iron overload, infections, or inflammatory diseases. Hepcidin excretion correlated well with serum ferritin levels, which are regulated by similar pathologic stimuli. In vitro iron loading of primary human hepatocytes, however, unexpectedly down-regulated hepcidin mRNA, suggesting that in vivo regulation of hepcidin expression by iron stores involves complex indirect effects. Hepcidin mRNA was dramatically induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6) in vitro, but not by IL-1 or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), demonstrating that human hepcidin is a type II acute-phase reactant. The linkage of hepcidin induction to inflammation in humans supports its proposed role as a key mediator of anemia of inflammation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Hepcidin is a liver-made peptide proposed to be a central regulator of intestinal iron absorption and iron recycling by macrophages.\"]}"}]}

The peptide hormone hepcidin is a key homeostatic regulator of iron metabolism and involved in pathological regulation of iron in response to infection, inflammation, hypoxia, and anemia. It acts by binding to the iron exporter ferroportin, causing it to be internalized and degraded; however, little is known about the structure/activity relationships of the interaction of hepcidin with ferroportin. We show that there are key residues in the N-terminal region of hepcidin that influence its interaction with ferroportin, and we explore the structure/function relationships at these positions. A series of hepcidin mutants in which disulfide bonds were replaced with diselenide bonds showed no change in activity compared to native hepcidin. These results identify important constraints for the development of hepcidin congeners for the treatment of hereditary iron overload.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The peptide hormone hepcidin is a key homeostatic regulator of iron metabolism and involved in pathological regulation of iron in response to infection, inflammation, hypoxia, and anemia.\"]}"}]}

Hepcidin is an iron-regulatory protein that is upregulated in response to increased iron or inflammatory stimuli. Hepcidin reduces serum iron and induces iron sequestration in the reticuloendothelial macrophages - the hallmark of anaemia of inflammation. Iron deprivation is used as a defense mechanism against infection, and it also has a beneficial effect on the control of cancer. The tumour-suppressor p53 transcriptionally regulates genes involved in growth arrest, apoptosis and DNA repair, and perturbation of p53 pathways is a hallmark of the majority of human cancers. This study inspected a role of p53 in the transcriptional regulation of hepcidin. Based on preliminary bioinformatics analysis, we identified a putative p53 response-element (p53RE) contained in the hepcidin gene (HAMP) promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), reporter assays and a temperature sensitive p53 cell-line system were used to demonstrate p53 binding and activation of the hepcidin promoter. p53 bound to hepcidin p53RE in vivo, andthis p53RE could confer p53-dependent transcriptional activation. Activation of p53 increased hepcidin expression, while silencing of p53 resulted in decreased hepcidin expression in human hepatoma cells. Taken together, these results define HAMP as a novel transcriptional target of p53. We hypothesise that hepcidin upregulation by p53 is part of a defence mechanism against cancer, through iron deprivation. Hepcidin induction by p53 might be involved in the pathogenesis of anaemia accompanying cancer.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Hepcidin is an iron-regulatory protein that is upregulated in response to increased iron or inflammatory stimuli.\"]}"}]}

Hepcidin, a 25-amino-acid peptide secreted by the liver, distributed in the plasma and excreted in urine, is a key central regulator of body iron homeostasis. This hormone decreases export of cellular iron by binding to ferroportin, an iron exporter present at the basolateral surface of enterocytes and macrophages (the sites of dietary iron absorption and iron recycling, respectively), inducing its internalization and degradation. Hepcidin contains eight cysteine residues that form four disulfide bridges, which stabilize a hairpin-shaped structure with two beta sheets. We noticed in the sequence of hepcidin a Cys*-X-Cys* motif which can act as a metal binding site able to trap iron and/or copper. We have tested this hypothesis using a pseudopeptidic synthetic bis-disulfide analogue and we have shown that direct metalation of such ligand leads to the formation of a copper(III) complex with the typical N(2)S(2)\u00a0donor set. This compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, space group Imma. The Cu(III) configuration is square planar, built up from two carboximado-N and two thiolato-S donors.

Human hepcidin, a 25-amino acid peptide made by hepatocytes, may be a new mediator of innate immunity and the long-sought iron-regulatory hormone. The synthesis of hepcidin is greatly stimulated by inflammation or by iron overload. Evidence from transgenic mouse models indicates that hepcidin is the predominant negative regulator of iron absorption in the small intestine, iron transport across the placenta, and iron release from macrophages. The key role of hepcidin is confirmed by the presence of nonsense mutations in the hepcidin gene, homozygous in the affected members, in 2 families with severe juvenile hemochromatosis. Recent evidence shows that deficient hepcidin response to iron loading may contribute to iron overload even in the much milder common form of hemochromatosis, from mutations in the HFE gene. In anemia of inflammation, hepcidin production is increased up to 100-fold and this may account for the defining feature of this condition, sequestration of iron in macrophages. The discovery of hepcidin and its role in iron metabolism could lead to new therapies for hemochromatosis and anemia of inflammation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron metabolism and mediator of anemia of inflammation.\"]}"}]}

Hepcidin is a small disulfide-rich peptide hormone that plays a key role in the regulation of iron homeostasis by binding and mediating the degradation of the cell membrane iron efflux transporter, ferroportin. Since it is a small peptide, chemical synthesis is a suitable approach for the preparation of mature human hepcidin. However, oxidative folding of synthetic hepcidin is extremely difficult due to its high cysteine content and high aggregation propensity. To improve its oxidative folding efficiency, we propose a reversible S-modification approach. Introduction of eight negatively charged sulfonate moieties into synthetic hepcidin significantly decreased its aggregation propensity and, under optimized conditions, dramatically increased the refolding yield. The folded hepcidin displayed a typical disulfide-constrained \u03b2-sheet structure and could induce internalization of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tagged ferroportin in transfected HEK293 cells. In order to study interactions between hepcidin and its receptor ferroportin, we propose a general approach for site-specific labeling of synthetic hepcidin analogues by incorporation of an L-propargylglycine during chemical synthesis. Following efficient oxidative refolding, a hepcidin analogue with Met20 replaced by L-propargylglycine was efficiently mono-labeled by a red fluorescent dye through click chemistry. The labeled hepcidin was internalized into the transfected cells together with the EGFP-tagged ferroportin, suggesting direct binding between hepcidin and ferroportin. The labeled hepcidin was also a suitable tool to visualize internalization of overexpressed or even endogenously expressed ferroportin without tags. We anticipate that the present refolding and labeling approaches could also be used for other synthetic peptides.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Hepcidin is a small disulfide-rich peptide hormone that plays a key role in the regulation of iron homeostasis by binding and mediating the degradation of the cell membrane iron efflux transporter, ferroportin.\"]}"}]}

We previously reported dynamic changes of serum hepcidin-25 levels in patients with hematologic malignancies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the association of pretransplant hepcidin-25 levels with overall survival (OS), engraftment, and other clinical outcomes of allo-HSCT in patients with hematologic malignancies. A total of 166 patients were divided into two groups depending on their pretransplant serum hepcidin-25 levels; their median age was 49.5\u00a0years, and the median follow-up time was 46.8\u00a0months. At 3\u00a0years, the patients in the high-hepcidin group had a significantly lower OS than those in the low-hepcidin group (49.2 vs. 69.0%, respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Multivariate analysis revealed that pretransplant serum hepcidin-25 level, sex, and disease status were independently associated with OS. The incidence of platelet engraftment was significantly lower in the high-hepcidin group than in the low-hepcidin group, whereas no significant differences were observed in neutrophil and reticulocyte engraftments between these groups.

Hepcidin is a key regulator controlling iron intestinal absorption and distribution through the body. The article by van der Putten et al. examined the association between hepcidin-25 and erythropoietin responsiveness and inflammation in erythropoietin-naive, iron-replete patients with chronic heart failure and chronic kidney disease. A cross-sectional observation revealed that serum hepcidin-25 was elevated almost twofold when compared with levels in healthy subjects. Hepcidin-25 was inversely correlated with hemoglobin (r(2) = 0.18; p < 0.02), and positively with ferritin (r(2) = 0.51; p < 0.01) and transferrin saturation (r(2) = 0.14; p < 0.03), while it did not correlate with levels of IL-6 and highly sensitive C-reactive protein. They found that 2-week erythropoietin therapy (50 IU/kg/week) significantly decreased hepcidin-25 levels. The magnitude of the decrease in hepcidin-25 levels correlated with the increase in reticulocytes (r(2) = 0.23; p < 0.03) and soluble transferrin receptor (r(2) = 0.23; p = 0.03), but not with inflammatory markers. A decline in hepcidin-25 correlated with the increment of hemoglobin after 6 months (r(2) = 0.49; p < 0.01). The findings convincingly suggest that hepcidin-25 may be useful in predicting erythropoietin responsiveness in stable chronic heart failure patients. However, further studies will be needed to establish clinically available methods to reliably measure hepcidin-25 level.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Hepcidin is a key regulator controlling iron intestinal absorption and distribution through the body.\"]}"}]}

The present study was aimed to assess possible relation between hepcidin and erythropoietin therapy, with particular attention being paid to erythropoietin-hyporesponsiveness in hemodialyzed patients. Prohepcidin and hepcidin were studied using commercially available kits from DRG Instruments GmbH, Germany (ELISA method) and Bachem, UK (RIA method). TNFalpha and IL-6 were studied using kits from and R&D (Abington, UK), and hsCRP was studied using kits from American Diagnostica, USA. Hyporesponsive patients to erythropoietin therapy had significantly lower serum albumin, cholesterol, LDL, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and residual renal function, and significantly higher serum ferritin, hsCRP, IL-6, TNFalpha, and erythropoietin dose. The difference in serum prohepcidin and hepcidin did not reach statistical significance; however, there was a tendency toward higher values of both prohepcidin and hepcidin in hyporesponsive patients. In conclusion, though hyporesponsiveness to erythropoietin therapy occur in dialyzed patients, it is mainly associated with subclinical inflammation than with hepcidin excess. Further studies are needed to develop a reliable and reproducible assay to elucidate the potential contribution of hepcidin to hyporesponsiveness during erythropoietin therapy.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Hepcidin is the key regulator of iron metabolism.\"]}"}]}

Hepcidin, originally discovered in urine as a bactericidal peptide synthesized by hepatocytes was later proved to be a key regulator of iron metabolism at the whole body level, namely, in conditions of altered iron demand such as the increased or decreased total amount of body iron, inflammation, hypoxia and anemia. The major mechanism of hepcidin function seems to be the regulation of transmembrane iron transport. Hepcidin binds to its receptor, protein ferroportin, which serves as a transmembrane iron channel enabling iron efflux from cells. The hepcidin-ferroportin complex is then degraded in lysosomes and iron is locked inside the cells (mainly enterocytes, hepatocytes and macrophages). This leads to lowering of iron absorption in the intestine and to a decrease in serum iron concentration. Utilizing this mechanism, hepcidin regulates serum iron levels during inflammation, infection and possibly also in cancer. Under these conditions iron is shifted from circulation into cellular stores in hepatocytes and macrophages, making it less available for invading microorganisms and tumor cells.

Hapcidin is the central regulator of iron homeostasis in the body. Primarily it is extracted from urine. Hepcidin is a 25 amino acid long chain peptide. Inflammation or iron overload greatly stimulate production of hepcidin by hepatocytes. Recent evidences have revealed that mutations in the human haemochromatosis (HFE) gene lead to deficiency of hepcidin which is responsible for iron overload and contributing to haemochromatosis. Moreover, hepcidin plays a key role in different types of anaemia, mainly anaemia of inflammation in which concentration of hepcidin increases up to 100 folds. Its contribution to renal disease, heart diseases, cancer and obesity-related disorders are also observed. On the other hand, its role is quite inevitable in understanding metastasis in certain cancers. By understanding the mechanism of hepcidin and its pathological roles in blood and iron diseases could lead to new therapies.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Hepcidin: A key regulator of iron.\"]}"}]}

Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron homeostasis, is known to have three isoforms: hepcidin-20, -22, and -25. Hepcidin-25 is thought to be the major isoform and the only one known to be involved in iron metabolism; the physiological roles of other isoforms are poorly understood. Because of its involvement in the pathophysiology of hereditary hemochromatosis and the anemia of chronic disease, the regulatory mechanisms of hepcidin expression have been extensively investigated, but most studies have been performed only at the transcriptional level. Difficulty in detecting hepcidin has impeded in vitro research. In the present study, we developed a novel method for simultaneous quantification of hepcidin-20, -22, and -25 in the media from hepatoma-derived cell lines. Using this method, we determined the expression patterns of hepcidin isoforms and the patterns of responses to various stimuli in human hepatoma-derived cultured cells. We found substantial differences among cell lines. In conclusion, a novel method for simultaneous quantification of hepcidin isoforms is presented. Heterogeneous expressions of hepcidin isoforms in human hepatoma-derived cells were revealed by this method. We believe our method will facilitate quantitative investigation of the role hepcidin plays in iron homeostasis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron homeostasis, is known to have three isoforms: hepcidin-20, -22, and -25.\"]}"}]}

Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron metabolism, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease. Although it is produced mainly in the liver, its recently described expression in adipose tissue has been shown to be enhanced in massive obesity due to chronic low-grade inflammation. Our objective was to study the changes in hepcidin expression in adipose tissue during acute-phase reaction. We measured hepcidin mRNA expression from isolated subcutaneous and epicardial adipose tissue at the beginning and at the end of the surgery. The expression of mRNAs for hepcidin and other iron-related genes (transferrin receptor 1, divalent metal transporter 1, ferritin, ferroportin) were measured by real-time RT-PCR. Hepcidin expression significantly increased at the end of the surgery in subcutaneous but not in epicardial adipose tissue. Apart from the increased levels of cytokines, the parameters of iron metabolism showed typical inflammation-induced changes. We suggest that acute inflammatory changes could affect the regulation of hepcidin expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue and thus possibly contribute to inflammation-induced systemic changes of iron metabolism.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron metabolism, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease.\"]}"}]}

Hepcidin, which is mainly produced by the liver, is the key regulator in iron homeostasis. Hepcidin expression is up-regulated by iron loading in vivo, but the mechanism underlying this process is not completely understood. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism, following the hypothesis that hepcidin production in response to iron loading is regulated by extra-hepatic iron sensors. We measured serum hepcidin concentrations and iron indices in Wistar rats treated with saccharated ferric oxide (SFO). Human hepatoma-derived HepG2 cells were stimulated using SFO-administered rat sera, and co-cultured with rat spleen cells, human monocyte-derived THP-1 cells, or human monocytes with diferric transferrin (holo-Tf), and hepcidin concentrations in the conditioned media were measured. SFO elevated rat serum hepcidin concentrations. SFO-treated rat sera increased hepcidin production from HepG2 cells, and this induction correlated with serum hepcidin levels, but not with iron indices. Holo-Tf up-regulated hepcidin concentrations in media from HepG2 cells co-cultured with rat spleen cells, THP-1 cells, or human monocytes with or without cell-to-cell contacts, while holo-Tf did not up-regulate hepcidin from HepG2 cells alone.

Hepcidin is the key regulator of iron absorption and recycling, and its expression is suppressed by red blood cell production. When erythropoiesis is expanded, hepcidin expression decreases. To gain insight into the stage of erythroid differentiation at which the regulation might originate, we measured serum hepcidin levels in archived pure red cell aplasia samples from patients whose block in erythroid differentiation was well defined by hematopoietic colony assays and marrow morphologic review. Hepcidin values are high or high normal in pure red cell aplasia patients in whom erythropoiesis is inhibited prior to the proerythroblast stage, but are suppressed in patients with excess proerythroblasts and few later erythroid cells. These data suggest that the suppressive effect of erythropoietic activity on hepcidin expression can arise from proerythroblasts, the stage at which transferrin receptor 1 expression peaks, prompting the hypothesis that transferrin receptor 1 expression on erythroid precursors is a proximal mediator of the erythroid regulator of hepcidin expression. Our characterization of erythropoiesis, iron status, and hepcidin expression in mice with global or hematopoietic cell-specific haploinsufficiency of transferrin receptor 1 provides initial supporting data for this model. The regulation appears independent of erythroferrone and growth differentiation factor 15, supporting the concept that several mechanisms signal iron need in response to an expanded erythron. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Hepcidin is the key regulator of iron absorption and recycling, and its expression is suppressed by red blood cell production.\"]}"}]}

Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron metabolism, decreases intestinal absorption of iron and its release from macrophages. Iron, anemia, hypoxia, and inflammation were reported to influence hepcidin expression. To investigate regulation of the expression of hepcidin and other iron-related genes, we manipulated erythropoietic activity in mice. Erythropoiesis was inhibited by irradiation or posttransfusion polycythemia and stimulated by phenylhydrazine administration and erythropoietin. Gene expression of hepcidin and other iron-related genes (hemojuvelin, DMT1, ferroportin, transferrin receptors, ferritin) in the liver was measured by the real-time polymerase chain reaction. Hepcidin expression increased despite severe anemia when hematopoiesis was inhibited by irradiation. Suppression of erythropoiesis by posttransfusion polycythemia or irradiation also increased hepcidin mRNA levels. Compensated hemolysis induced by repeated phenylhydrazine administration did not change hepcidin expression. The decrease caused by exogenous erythropoeitin was blocked by postirradiation bone marrow suppression. The hemolysis and anemia decrease hepcidin expression only when erythropoiesis is functional; on the other hand, if erythropoiesis is blocked, even severe anemia does not lead to a decrease of hepcidin expression, which is indeed increased. We propose that hepcidin is exclusively sensitive to iron utilization for erythropoiesis and hepatocyte iron balance, and these changes are not sensed by other genes involved in the control of iron metabolism in the liver.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron metabolism, decreases intestinal absorption of iron and its release from macrophages.\"]}"}]}

Hepcidin is a key regulator of iron homeostasis and plays a role in the pathogenesis of anaemia of chronic disease. Its levels are increased in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to diminished renal clearance and an inflammatory state. Increased hepcidin levels in CKD patients are supposed to be responsible for functional iron deficiency in these patients and contribute to renal anaemia and resistance to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Therefore, hepcidin was purported to be useful as a management tool guiding treatment of renal anaemia. Furthermore, since hepcidin is associated with iron accumulation in macrophages in the vessel wall inducing oxidative stress and atherosclerosis, it has been speculated that hepcidin might function as a biomarker of cardiovascular disease. In this descriptive review, the merits of hepcidin with respect to its role in the pathophysiology of renal anaemia in CKD patients, its presumptive role as a practical diagnostic tool guiding management of renal anaemia, and its possible usefulness as a prognostic biomarker will be discussed. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Hepcidin is a key regulator of iron homeostasis and plays a role in the pathogenesis of anaemia of chronic disease.\"]}"}]}

Hepcidin is a central regulator of iron metabolism. Serum hepcidin levels are increased in patients with renal insufficiency, which may contribute to anemia. Urine hepcidin was found to be increased in some patients after cardiac surgery, and these patients were less likely to develop acute kidney injury. It has been suggested that urine hepcidin may protect by attenuating heme-mediated injury, but processes involved in urine hepcidin excretion are unknown. To assess the role of tubular reabsorption we compared fractional excretion (FE) of hepcidin-25 with FE of \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b2(2)m) in 30 patients with various degrees of tubular impairment due to chronic renal disease. To prove that hepcidin is reabsorbed by the tubules in a megalin-dependent manner, we measured urine hepcidin-1 in wild-type and kidney specific megalin-deficient mice. Lastly, we evaluated FE of hepcidin-25 and \u03b2(2)m in 19 patients who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Hepcidin was measured by a mass spectrometry assay (MS), whereas \u03b2(2)m was measured by ELISA. In patients with chronic renal disease, FE of hepcidin-25 was strongly correlated with FE of \u03b2(2)m (r = 0.93, P <0.01). In megalin-deficient mice, urine hepcidin-1 was 7-fold increased compared to wild-type mice (p < 0.01) indicating that proximal tubular reabsorption occurs in a megalin- dependent manner. Following cardiac surgery, FE of hepcidin-25 increased despite a decline in FE of \u03b2(2)m, potentially indicating local production at 12-24 hours. Hepcidin-25 is reabsorbed by the renal tubules and increased urine hepcidin-25 levels may reflect a reduction in tubular uptake. Uncoupling of FE of hepcidin-25 and \u03b2(2)m in cardiac surgery patients suggests local production.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"BACKGROUND: Hepcidin is a central regulator of iron metabolism.

Hepcidin is a key regulator of iron metabolism. It binds to ferroportin and causes the trapping of iron in cells, rendering it unavailable for erythropoiesis.

Our aim was to describe the relationship between hepcidin and other parameters of iron metabolism, erythropoiesis, and inflammation. Complete blood cell counts, hepcidin, parameters of iron metabolism, and inflammation were measured in samples from 164 dialysed patients and 37 control healthy volunteers. Patients were subdivided according to the time of dialysis session. According to the time of haemodialysis, iron levels showed an insignificant tendency for diurnal variability, whereas hepcidin levels were markedly different. Non-parametric correlations showed a weak, but statistically significant correlation between parameters of iron metabolism and inflammation in the entire group of patients. No correlation was found between hepcidin and other biochemical parameters in controls. Non-parametric correlations were also performed in the time subgroups of patients. It seems that the influence of inflammation on hepcidin levels in haemodialysed patients is not crucial and other factors (e.g. hepcidin retention) are involved.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"BACKGROUND: Hepcidin is a key regulator of iron metabolism.

Hepcidin is a key regulator of iron homeostasis, while hemojuvelin is an important component of the hepcidin regulation pathway. It has been recently proposed that soluble hemojuvelin, produced from hemojuvelin by the protease furin, decreases hepcidin expression. The aim of the presented study was to examine the downregulation of hepcidin by chronic bleeding in hemojuvelin-mutant mice. Male mice with targeted disruption of the hemojuvelin gene (Hjv-/- mice) and wild-type littermates were maintained on an iron-deficient diet and subjected to weekly phlebotomies for 7 weeks. Gene expression was examined by real-time PCR. In wild type mice, repeated bleeding decreased hepcidin mRNA by two orders of magnitude. In Hjv-/- mice, basal hepcidin expression was low; however, repeated bleeding also decreased hepcidin mRNA content by an order of magnitude. Phlebotomies reduced hepatic iron overload in Hjv-/- mice by 80 %. Liver and muscle furin mRNA content was not significantly changed. No effect on hepatic Tmprss6 mRNA content was observed. Results from the study indicate that soluble hemojuvelin is not the sole factor responsible for hepcidin downregulation.

The temporal associations between plasma cytokines, hepcidin levels, and serum iron parameters were studied in 10 healthy individuals after LPS injection. IL-6 was dramatically induced within 3 hours after injection, and urinary hepcidin peaked within 6 hours, followed by a significant decrease in serum iron.

Iron is required for many biological processes but is also toxic in excess; thus, body iron balance is maintained through sophisticated regulatory mechanisms. The lack of a regulated iron excretory mechanism means that body iron balance is controlled at the level of absorption from the diet. Iron absorption is regulated by the hepatic peptide hormone hepcidin. Hepcidin also controls iron release from cells that recycle or store iron, thus regulating plasma iron concentrations. Hepcidin exerts its effects through its receptor, the cellular iron exporter ferroportin. Important regulators of hepcidin, and therefore of systemic iron homeostasis, include plasma iron concentrations, body iron stores, infection and inflammation, and erythropoiesis. Disturbances in the regulation of hepcidin contribute to the pathogenesis of many iron disorders: hepcidin deficiency causes iron overload in hereditary hemochromatosis and nontransfused \u03b2-thalassemia, whereas overproduction of hepcidin is associated with iron-restricted anemias seen in patients with chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammatory diseases, some cancers, and inherited iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia. This review summarizes our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in the control of hepcidin synthesis in the liver, a principal determinant of plasma hepcidin concentrations.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Regulation of the Iron Homeostatic Hormone Hepcidin.\"]}"}]}

Iron is an essential metal for cell survival that is regulated by the peptide hormone hepcidin. However, its influence on certain diseases is directly related to iron metabolism or secondary to underlying diseases. Genetic alterations influence the serum hepcidin concentration, which can lead to an iron overload in tissues, as observed in haemochromatosis, in which serum hepcidin or defective hepcidin synthesis is observed. Another genetic imbalance of iron is iron-refractory anaemia, in which serum concentrations of hepcidin are increased, precluding the flow and efflux of extra- and intracellular iron. During the pathogenesis of certain diseases, the resulting oxidative stress, as well as the increase in inflammatory cytokines, influences the transcription of the HAMP gene to generate a secondary anaemia due to the increase in the serum concentration of hepcidin. To date, there is no available drug to inhibit or enhance hepcidin transcription, mostly due to the cytotoxicity described in the in vitro models. The proposed therapeutic targets are still in the early stages of clinical trials. Some candidates are promising, such as heparin derivatives and minihepcidins. This review describes the main pathways of systemic and genetic regulation of hepcidin, as well as its influence on the disorders related to iron metabolism.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Iron is an essential metal for cell survival that is regulated by the peptide hormone hepcidin.

High-risk patients are currently being evaluated for various catheter-based aortic valve replacement (AVR) techniques. To identify an individual patient's risk, scores such as the EuroSCORE or STS risk calculator (RC) are used. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the surgical results in patients who underwent isolated AVR via a median re-sternotomy after prior CABG. Between 01/96 and 01/08, 349 patients underwent AVR as a redo procedure. One hundred and thirty patients had undergone previous CABG; in 39 patients (29 male, median age 75 (60-84)) preoperative coronary angiography revealed open grafts with no need for additional revascularization (30 had LIMA grafts). These patients underwent isolated AVR. Operative mortality was calculated using the standard and logistic EuroSCORE, and the STS RC. Operative (30-day mortality) was 5% (2 patients). Mean calculated predicted mortality rates for the cohort were: 12+/-3% for the standard, and 32+/-21% for the logistic EuroSCORE, and 10+/-4% according to the STS RC. Receiver operated characteristics (ROC) analysis revealed 100% specificity for standard EuroSCOREs up to 12.5%, logistic EuroSCOREs up to 39.7% and up to 17.45% for STS RC, with a sensitivity of 69.5%, 75% and 97.2%, respectively. The STS RC showed significant better prediction of mortality than the EuroSCOREs (p=0.006). Conventional AVR as a redo procedure after CABG with patent grafts can be performed with excellent results and lower mortality than estimated. Results of newer catheter-based AVR approaches should not to be compared with artificial scores to justify high morbidity rates.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

A general and sensitive method for detecting divalent anions by ESI-MS and LC/ESI-MS as positive ions has been developed. The anions are paired with tricationic reagents to form positively charged complexes. In this study, four tricationic reagents, 2 trigonal and 2 linear, were used to study a wide variety of anions, such as disulfonates, dicarboxylates, and inorganic anions. The limits of detection for many of the anions studied were often improved by tandem mass spectrometry. Tricationic pairing agents can also be used with chromatography to enhance the detection of anions. The tricationic reagents were also used to detect monovalent anions by monitoring the doubly charged positive complex. The limits of detection for some of the divalent anions by this method are substantially lower than by other current analytical techniques.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Probing microarray assays in the presence of a hybridization mix retrieves precious information on hybridization kinetics. However, in common detection schemes, useful surface signals compete with the high supernatant background from labelled targets in the mix. A known solution consists in exciting specifically the microarray surface with evanescent fields. Configurations using planar optical waveguides to produce such fields are shown here to present also a dramatic excitation irradiance enhancement at the guide/surrounding matter interface. We compare theoretically and experimentally a guided excitation with a classical external excitation. A full electromagnetic analysis predicts an irradiance increase higher than 10(4) for adequately tailored waveguides. We deposited high-index TiO(2) sol-gel waveguides on glass substrates according to best simulations. Quantitative enhancement analysis exploiting actual biological fluorescent spots perfectly confirms the irradiance amplification effect of a thin waveguide. The impact of amplification on the design of biochip readers is discussed since it leaves ample margin for simple and low-cost light couplers, advantageous in affordable readers and sensor systems.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Mass spectrometry is fast becoming a vital approach not only for the identification and quantification of proteins, but also for the study of the noncovalent assemblies they form. Approaches for ionizing, transmitting, and detecting protein complexes intact in the mass spectrometer are now well established. The challenge has therefore shifted to developing and applying mass spectrometry approaches to elucidate the structure of such species. A crucial aspect to this goal is inducing their disassembly in the gas phase to mine information as to their composition and organization. Here the consequences of collisionally activating protein complexes are illustrated through ion mobility mass spectrometry measurements and discussed in the context of the current literature. Although a consensus view of the mechanism of dissociation is starting to emerge, it is also clear that a number of aspects remain unresolved. These outstanding questions and frontier challenges must be addressed if gas-phase dissociative approaches are to reach their full potential in the study of protein assemblies.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The efficacy of breast-conserving surgery for the local control of early breast cancer has been repeatedly evidenced. Although immediate reconstruction following breast-conserving surgery has been described, little information is available regarding surgical management in reoperative settings due to positive margins. We studied the influence of intraoperatively assessed and postoperatively controlled surgical margin status on the type of breast-conserving surgery and report our results regarding complications in a reoperative breast reconstruction scenario. All patients were seen by a multidisciplinary team who recommended breast-conserving surgery. According to the breast volume, ptosis and tumor size/location, the patients were also evaluated by a plastic surgeon, who recommended reconstruction with the appropriate technique. Intraoperative assessment of surgical margins was determined by histological examination of frozen sections. The mean follow-up time was 48 months. Two hundred and eighteen patients (88.5%) underwent breast-conserving surgery and immediate reconstruction. Twelve (5.5%) patients had a positive tumor margin after review of the permanent section. All patients underwent re-exploration. In 1.3%, a second reconstructive technique was indicated and in 2.2% a skin-sparing mastectomy with total reconstruction was performed. Our findings support the important role of the intraoperative assessment of surgical margins and its interference in the selection of reconstruction techniques and negative margins; however, it will not guarantee complete excision of the tumor. Success depends on coordinated planning with the oncologic surgeon and careful intraoperative management.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Under harsh environmental conditions, Caenorhabditis elegans larvae undergo arrest and form dauer larvae that can attach to other animals to facilitate dispersal. It has been argued that this phenomenon, called phoresy, represents an intermediate step toward parasitism. Indeed, parasitic nematodes invade their hosts as infective larvae, a stage that shows striking morphological similarities to dauer larvae. Although the molecular regulation of dauer entry in C. elegans involves insulin and TGF-beta signaling, studies of TGF-beta orthologs in parasitic nematodes didn't provide evidence for a common origin of dauer and infective larvae. To identify conserved regulators between Caenorhabditis and parasitic nematodes, we used an evolutionary approach involving Pristionchus pacificus as an intermediate. We show by mutational and pharmacological analysis that Pristionchus and Caenorhabditis share the dafachronic acid-DAF-12 system as the core endocrine module for dauer formation. One dafachronic acid, Delta7-DA, has a conserved role in the mammalian parasite Strongyloides papillosus by controlling entry into the infective stage. Application of Delta7-DA blocks formation of infective larvae and results in free-living animals. Conservation of this small molecule ligand represents a fundamental link between dauer and infective larvae and might provide a general strategy for nematode parasitism.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In many species, germ cells form in a specialized germ plasm, which contains localized maternal RNAs. In the absence of active transcription in early germ cells, these maternal RNAs encode germ-cell components with critical functions in germ-cell specification, migration, and development. For several RNAs, localization has been correlated with release from translational repression, suggesting an important regulatory function linked to localization. To address the role of RNA localization and translational control more systematically, we assembled a comprehensive set of RNAs that are localized to polar granules, the characteristic germ-plasm organelles. We find that the 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of all RNAs tested control RNA localization and instruct distinct temporal patterns of translation of the localized RNAs. We demonstrate necessity for translational timing by swapping the 3'UTR of polar granule component (pgc), which controls translation in germ cells, with that of nanos, which is translated earlier. Translational activation of pgc is concurrent with extension of its poly(A) tail length but appears largely independent of the Drosophila CPEB homolog ORB. Our results demonstrate a role for 3'UTR mediated translational regulation in fine-tuning the temporal expression of localized RNA, and this may provide a paradigm for other RNAs that are found enriched at distinct cellular locations such as the leading edge of fibroblasts or the neuronal synapse.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Insects and fungi share a long history of association in various habitats, including the wood-decomposition niche. Fungal mimicry of termite eggs is one of the most striking evolutionary consequences of insect-fungus association. Termites of the genus Reticulitermes often harbor fungal sclerotia, called \"termite balls,\" along with eggs in nursery chambers, whereby the fungus gains a competitor-free habitat in termite nests. Sophisticated morphological and chemical camouflage are needed for the fungus to mimic termite eggs. However, the mechanism of chemical egg mimicry by the fungus is unknown. Here, we show that the fungus mimics termite eggs chemically by producing the cellulose-digesting enzyme beta-glucosidase. We found that the termite egg-recognition pheromone consists of beta-glucosidase and lysozyme. Both enzymes are major salivary compounds in termites and are also produced in termite eggs. Termite balls were tended by termites only when the fungus produced beta-glucosidase. Our results demonstrated that the overlap of the cellulose digestion niche between termites and the fungus sharing the same chemicals provided the opportunity for the origin of termite egg mimicry by the fungus. This suggests that pheromone compounds might have originally evolved within other life history contexts, only later gaining function in chemical communication.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is the latest and perhaps most significant innovation in surgery since Phillipe Mouret of France performed the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1987. This new \"minimum-invasive\" concept that promises scar-free surgery is steadily gathering momentum. It is another milestone in our quest to eliminate surgical trauma, speed patient recovery time and decrease surgical wound-related complications. On 22 July 2005, the Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research (NOSCAR) published a white paper highlighting the barriers to NOTES development, which included the need for appropriate selection of access points, effective closure of the enterotomy site, innovative tools, stable platforms and improved endoscopic orientation. These are just some of the many issues that need to be resolved before the NOTES concept and technique could become a common feature of modern surgery. The publication of the white paper ushered in the beginning of multiple research projects using animal models to test the application of NOTES and its newly developed instruments. The success in animal models was followed by several highly selected successful human trials. National and international surgical innovation departments should now be created where medical industry personnel including inventors, designers and engineers can work together with the medical and surgical providers to address all the limitations affecting NOTES progress.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In complex with the pseudokinase STRAD and the scaffolding protein MO25, LKB1 phosphorylates and activates AMPK family kinases, which mediate many cellular processes. The prototypical family member AMPK regulates cell energy metabolism and epithelial apicobasal polarity. This latter event is also dependent on E-cadherin-mediated adherens junctions (AJs) at lateral borders. Strikingly, overexpression of LKB1/STRAD can also trigger establishment of epithelial polarity in the absence of cell-cell or cell-matrix contacts. However, the upstream factors that normally govern LKB1/STRAD function are unknown. Here we show by immunostaining and fluorescence resonance energy transfer that active LKB1/STRAD kinase complex colocalizes with E-cadherin at AJs. LKB1/STRAD localization and AMPK phosphorylation require E-cadherin-dependent maturation of AJs. However, LKB1/STRAD complex kinase activity is E-cadherin independent. These data suggest that in polarized epithelial cells, E-cadherin regulates AMPK phosphorylation by controlling the localization of the LKB1 complex. The LKB1 complex therefore appears to function downstream of E-cadherin in tumor suppression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Carvedilol suppressed apoptosis of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC through modification of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, whose was associated with an increase of Cav 1.2 protein expression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

While on foraging excursions, fiddler crabs track their burrow location despite having no visual contact with it . They do this by path integration, a common navigational process in which motion vectors (the direction and distance of animals' movements) are summed to form a single \"home vector\" linking the current location with the point of origin. Here, we identify the mechanism by which the integrator measures distance, by decoupling motor output from both inertial and visual feedback. Fiddler crabs were passively translated to a position such that the home vector lay across an acetate sheet on the ground. After being frightened, crabs tried to escape but slipped as they did so. Detailed high-speed video analysis reveals that crabs measure distance by integrating strides, rather than linear acceleration or optic flow: the number of steps they took depended on both the length of the home vector and how large their steps were, whether they slipped and fell short or not. This is the most direct evidence to date of a stride integrator that is flexible enough to account for significant variation in stride length and frequency.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Memory deficits in aging affect millions of people and are often disturbing to those concerned. Dissection of the molecular control of learning and memory is paramount to understand and possibly enhance cognitive functions. Old-age memory loss also has been recently linked to altered Ca(2+) homeostasis. We have previously identified DREAM (downstream regulatory element antagonistic modulator), a member of the neuronal Ca(2+) sensor superfamily of EF-hand proteins, with specific roles in different cell compartments. In the nucleus, DREAM is a Ca(2+)-dependent transcriptional repressor, binding to specific DNA signatures, or interacting with nucleoproteins regulating their transcriptional properties. Also, we and others have shown that dream mutant (dream(-/-)) mice exhibit marked analgesia. Here we report that dream(-/-) mice exhibit markedly enhanced learning and synaptic plasticity related to improved cognition. Mechanistically, DREAM functions as a negative regulator of the key memory factor CREB in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, and loss of DREAM facilitates CREB-dependent transcription during learning. Intriguingly, 18-month-old dream(-/-) mice display learning and memory capacities similar to young mice. Moreover, loss of DREAM protects from brain degeneration in aging. These data identify the Ca(2+)-regulated \"pain gene\" DREAM as a novel key regulator of memory and brain aging.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the prototype of primary humoral immunodeficiencies. Long-term follow-up studies regarding disease-related complications and outcome are scarce. Our aim was to describe the natural history of XLA. A nationwide multicenter study based on the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry was established in 2000 in Italy. Affected patients were enrolled by documenting centers, and the patients' laboratory, clinical, and imaging data were recorded on an annual base. Data on the patients (N\u00a0= 168) were derived from a cumulative follow-up of 1370 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 8.35 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis decreased after establishment of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry (84 months before vs 23 months after). Respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent clinical symptoms at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Regular immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduced the incidence of invasive infections. Affected patients developed chronic lung disease over time (47% after 40 years of follow-up) in the presence of chronic sinusitis (84%). Malignancies were documented in a minority of cases (3.7%). Overall survival for affected patients was significantly reduced when compared with that for the healthy male Italian population, and it further deteriorated in the presence of chronic lung disease. This is the first detailed long-term follow-up study for patients with XLA, revealing that although immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduces the incidence of invasive infections, it does not appear to influence the development of chronic lung disease. The overall survival of affected patients is reduced. Further studies are warranted to improve patients' clinical management and increase awareness among physicians.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

A novel automated chemiluminescence (CL) read-out system for analytical flow-through microarrays based on multiplexed immunoassays has been developed. The microarray chip reader (MCR 3) is designed as a stand-alone platform, with the goal to quantify multiple analytes in complex matrices of food and liquid samples for field analysis or for routine analytical laboratories. The CL microarray platform is a self-contained system for the fully automated multiplexed immunoanalysis: the microarray chip, the fluidic system and the software module enable automated calibration and determination of analyte concentrations during a whole working day. The detection of antibiotics in milk was demonstrated to validate this device. There are few quantitative multi-residue detection methods for routine analysis although the EU has defined maximum residue limits (MRLs) for a number of antibacterial reagents. Therefore, an automated multianalyte detection instrument is needed quantifying simultaneously antibiotics within some minutes. Also regeneration is required to avoid replacing the assay surface. The MCR 3 uses a microarray chip, which consists of two channels for parallel measurement and regeneration. The microarray chip is designed for parallel analysis of up to 13 different antibiotics in milk applying an indirect competitive microarray immunoassay (MIA). Microspotted antibiotics are directly coupled to epoxylated PEG surfaces. As an initial example, penicillin G is quantified in milk on the MCR 3. The penicillin G surface is regenerable for 47 measurement cycles per channel.

The thymus is critical for central tolerance and diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire development, to provide lifelong defense against pathogens while maintaining self-tolerance. Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The simulation of exit wavefunctions of a TEM sample is carried out by both the conventional multislice (C-MS) method and the real space multislice (RS-MS) method, with a series of different slice thicknesses. Surprisingly, the results calculated by the RS-MS method remain constant to seven significant figures when the slice thicknesses are changed within a wide range, while those calculated by the C-MS method change significantly. From the mathematical point of view, the C-MS method is only a first order approximation of the RS-MS method. Thus, the calculation precision of the RS-MS method is much higher than that of the C-MS method. Or to achieve the same precision, the slice thickness for the RS-MS method can be taken as two orders of magnitude larger than for the C-MS method in the simulation. As a result, the calculation speed for the RS-MS method may be even faster than that for the C-MS method in some cases. For the two advantages stated above, the RS-MS method may be more suitable for precise calculations.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

This study was designed to compare biomechanical characteristics of the knee joint for several athletic tasks to elucidate their effects and to examine what tasks pose a risk for ACL injury. Three athletic tasks were performed by 24 female athletes: single-limb landing, plant and cutting, and both-limb jump landing. Angular displacements of flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and external/internal tibial rotation were calculated. Angular excursion and the rate of excursion of abduction and internal tibial rotation were also calculated. During plant and cutting, from foot contact, subjects rotated the tibia more rapidly and to a greater degree toward internal tibial rotation. Moreover, excursion of knee abduction is greater than that during single-limb landing. During both-limb jump landing, the knee flexion at foot contact was greater than for either single-limb landing or plant and cutting; peak knee abduction was greater than for either single-limb landing or plant and cutting. In plant and cutting, the risk of ACL injury is increased by greater excursion and more rapid knee abduction than that which occurs in single-limb landing, in addition to greater internal tibial rotation. Although single-limb tasks apparently pose a greater risk for ACL injury than bilateral landings, both-limb landing with greater knee abduction might also risk ACL injury.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

An initial screen of kinase-directed inhibitors identified an active pyrazolo-pyrimidine scaffold that was iteratively modified and screened against a collective of GroEL nucleotide pocket variants to identify a cyclopentyl carboxamide derivative, EC3016, that specifically inhibits ATPase activity and protein folding by the GroEL mutant, I493C, involving a side chain positioned near the base of ATP. This orthogonal pair will enable in vitro studies of the action of ATP in triggering activation of GroEL-mediated protein folding and might enable further studies of GroEL action in vivo. The approach originated for studying kinases by Shokat and his colleagues may thus also be used to study large macromolecular machines.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Sunlight is attenuated rapidly in the ocean, resulting in little visually useful light reaching deeper than approximately 1000 m in even the clearest water. To maximize sensitivity to the relatively brighter downwelling sunlight, to view the silhouette of animals above them, and to increase the binocular overlap of their eyes, many mesopelagic animals have developed upward-pointing tubular eyes. However, these sacrifice the ability to detect bioluminescent and reflective objects in other directions. Thus, some mesopelagic fish with tubular eyes extend their visual fields laterally and/or ventrally by lensless ocular diverticula, which are thought to provide unfocused images, allowing only simple detection of objects, with little spatial resolution. Here, we show that a medial mirror within the ventrally facing ocular diverticulum of the spookfish, Dolichopteryx longipes, consisting of a multilayer stack derived from a retinal tapetum, is used to reflect light onto a lateral retina. The reflective plates are not orientated parallel to the surface of the mirror. Instead, plate angles change progressively around the mirror, and computer modeling indicates that this provides a well-focused image. This is the first report of an ocular image being formed in a vertebrate eye by a mirror.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Cytochrome P450 1A1 is a major enzyme in the bioactivation of exogenous procarcinogens of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the contribution of common genetic variants in CYP1A1 to the HCC risk in Chinese populations has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we examined the association between HCC and four selected tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP1A1, and the risk of CYP1A1 haplotypes/diplotypes in 1006 pathologically confirmed HCC patients and 1015 cancer-free controls, from a Han Chinese population. Haplotypes/diplotypes were constructed from observed genotypes using the Haplo.Stats program. Relative risk was estimated by using multivariable logistic regression method. To summarise, we detected an increased HCC risk in rs4646421 variant carriers (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.61) and rs2198843 variant carriers (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.69), and a reduced risk of HCC (OR 0.70. 95% CI 0.52-0.94) associated with homozygote carriers of rs4886605 variant. These association signals were also observed in non-smokers with rs4646421 (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.16-2.08) and rs4886605 (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.91). Compared to the most common CYP1A1 haplotype CCAG, the haplotype TTGC conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.52). Similarly, the TTGC/TTGC diplotype conferred an increased risk of HCC compared with diplotype CCAG/CCAG (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.23-3.45, P=0.006). Interestingly, the diplotype TTAC/CCAG also conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.22-2.54, P=0.003). Our results suggested that common genetic variants in CYP1A1 may modulate the risk of developing HCC in the study population, particularly in non-smokers. However, our findings need to be validated in at least one independent study of Han Chinese population.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Although fever is part of the normal inflammatory process after immunisation, prophylactic antipyretic drugs are sometimes recommended to allay concerns of high fever and febrile convulsion. We assessed the effect of prophylactic administration of paracetamol at vaccination on infant febrile reaction rates and vaccine responses. In two consecutive (primary and booster) randomised, controlled, open-label vaccination studies, 459 healthy infants were enrolled from ten centres in the Czech Republic. Infants were randomly assigned with a computer-generated randomisation list to receive three prophylactic paracetamol doses every 6-8 h in the first 24 h (n=226) or no prophylactic paracetamol (n=233) after each vaccination with a ten-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D-conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) co-administered with the hexavalent diphtheria-tetanus-3-component acellular pertussis-hepatitis B-inactivated poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3-H influenzae type b (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib) and oral human rotavirus vaccines. The primary objective in both studies was the reduction in febrile reactions of 38.0 degrees C or greater in the total vaccinated cohort. The second objective was assessment of immunogenicity in the according-to-protocol cohort. These studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00370318 and NCT00496015. Fever greater than 39.5 degrees C was uncommon in both groups (after primary: one of 226 participants [<1%] in prophylactic paracetamol group vs three of 233 [1%] in no prophylactic paracetamol group; after booster: three of 178 [2%] vs two of 172 [1%]). The percentage of children with temperature of 38 degrees C or greater after at least one dose was significantly lower in the prophylactic paracetamol group (94/226 [42%] after primary vaccination and 64/178 [36%] after booster vaccination) than in the no prophylactic paracetamol group (154/233 [66%] after primary vaccination and 100/172 [58%] after booster vaccination).

Worldwide, paracetamol is administered as a remedy for complaints that occur after vaccination. Recently published results indicate that paracetamol inhibits the vaccination response in infants when given prior to vaccination. The goal of this study was to establish whether paracetamol exerts similar effects in young adults. In addition, the effect of timing of paracetamol intake was investigated. In two randomized, controlled, open-label studies 496 healthy young adults were randomly assigned to three groups. The study groups received paracetamol for 24 hours starting at the time of (prophylactic use) - or 6 hours after (therapeutic use) the primary (0 month) and first booster (1 month) hepatitis B vaccination. The control group received no paracetamol. None of the participants used paracetamol around the second booster (6 months) vaccination. Anti-HBs levels were measured prior to and one month after the second booster vaccination on ADVIA Centaur XP. One month after the second booster vaccination, the anti-HBs level in the prophylactic paracetamol group was significantly lower (p = 0.048) than the level in the control group (4257 mIU/mL vs. 5768 mIU/mL).

Only few randomized clinical trials demonstrated blunted antibody response of unknown clinical significance. This effect has only been noted following primary vaccination with novel antigens and disappears following booster immunization. The mechanism by which antipyretic analgesics reduce antibody response remains unclear and not fully explained by COX enzyme inhibition. Recent work has focused on the involvement of nuclear and subcellular signaling pathways. More detailed immunological investigations and a systems biology approach are needed to precisely define the impact and mechanism of antipyretic effects on vaccine immune responses.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"While antipyretic analgesics are widely used to ameliorate vaccine adverse reactions, their use has been associated with blunted vaccine immune responses.\"]}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Carvedilol suppressed apoptosis of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC through modification of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, whose was associated with an increase of Cav 1.2 protein expression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To assess clinical experience of the first 11 adult patients who received rhC1INH in clinical practice in the UK. Eleven patients (nine HAE type 1, one HAE type 2 and one acquired angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency) received between one and six, mostly self-administered, doses of rhC1INH for acute HAE attacks. They were asked to record their time to first response and complete resolution following the treatment. This cohort included our most severely affected and difficult to treat patients. In most cases, time to first improvement following rhC1INH and complete resolution was recorded as comparable to their typical response to pdC1INH, although 4/11 patients reported that the time to first improvement was much quicker than their average pdC1INH response. Five of the 11 patients continued with rhC1INH as their preferred rescue treatment. Of those who chose not to continue the treatment, four reported a recurrence or early return of symptoms with rhC1INH. In our experience, rhC1INH is a beneficial treatment for patients with preference for a C1INH that is not plasma derived and it is suitable for home treatment. In some cases it demonstrates cost saving, especially for heavier patients who require higher doses. In some patients rhC1INH may result in faster resolution of symptoms. It may be associated with an early return of symptoms in patients with exceptionally frequent attacks.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Conestat alfa (Ruconest, rhC1INH) is the first recombinant human C1 inhibitor protein (C1INH) for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE).\"]}"}]}

The novel morpholino antisense oligonucleotide viltolarsen targets exon 53 of the dystrophin gene, and could be an effective treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We investigated viltolarsen's ability to induce dystrophin expression and examined its safety in DMD patients. In this open-label, multicenter, parallel-group, phase 1/2, exploratory study, 16 ambulant and nonambulant males aged 5-12\u00a0years with DMD received viltolarsen 40 or 80\u00a0mg/kg/week via intravenous infusion for 24\u00a0weeks. Primary endpoints were dystrophin expression and exon 53 skipping levels. In western blot analysis, mean changes in dystrophin expression (% normal) from baseline to Weeks 12 and 24 were\u00a0-\u00a01.21 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.5136) and 1.46 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.1636), respectively, in the 40\u00a0mg/kg group, and 0.76 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.2367) and 4.81 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0536), respectively, in the 80\u00a0mg/kg group. The increase in mean dystrophin level at Weeks 12 and 24 was significant in the 80\u00a0mg/kg group (2.78%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.0364). Patients receiving 80\u00a0mg/kg showed a higher mean exon 53 skipping level (42.4%) than those receiving 40\u00a0mg/kg (21.8%). All adverse events were judged to be mild or moderate in intensity and none led to study discontinuation. Treatment with viltolarsen 40 or 80\u00a0mg/kg elicited an increasing trend in dystrophin expression and exon 53 skipping levels, and was safe and well tolerated. The decline in motor function appeared less marked in patients with higher dystrophin levels; this may warrant further investigation. This study supports the potential clinical benefit of viltolarsen.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"OBJECTIVE: The novel morpholino antisense oligonucleotide viltolarsen targets exon 53 of the dystrophin gene, and could be an effective treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystr\"]}"}]}

In particular, PMOs for skipping exon 44 have been developing in clinical trials, such as the drug NS-089/NCNP-02. Two exon 53 skipping PMOs, golodirsen and viltolarsen, have received conditional approval for treating patients due to their ability to restore dystrophin protein expression. Although promising, further development of exon-skipping technology is needed for patients to have more therapeutic benefit. This chapter describes evaluation methods of exon 44 and 53 skipping PMOs in immortalized DMD patient-derived skeletal muscle cells.

An unmet need remains for safe and efficacious treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). To date, there are limited agents available that address the underlying cause of the disease. To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of viltolarsen, a novel antisense oligonucleotide, in participants with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping. This phase 2 study was a 4-week randomized clinical trial for safety followed by a 20-week open-label treatment period of patients aged 4 to 9 years with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping. To enroll 16 participants, with 8 participants in each of the 2 dose cohorts, 17 participants were screened. Study enrollment occurred between December 16, 2016, and August 17, 2017, at sites in the US and Canada. Data were collected from December 2016 to February 2018, and data were analyzed from April 2018 to May 2019. Participants received 40 mg/kg (low dose) or 80 mg/kg (high dose) of viltolarsen administered by weekly intravenous infusion. Primary outcomes of the trial included safety, tolerability, and de novo dystrophin protein production measured by Western blot in participants' biceps muscles. Secondary outcomes included additional assessments of dystrophin mRNA and protein production as well as clinical muscle strength and function. Of the 16 included boys with DMD, 15 (94%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 7.4 (1.8) years. After 20 to 24 weeks of treatment, significant drug-induced dystrophin production was seen in both viltolarsen dose cohorts (40 mg/kg per week: mean [range] 5.7% [3.2-10.3] of normal; 80 mg/kg per week: mean [range] 5.9% [1.1-14.4] of normal). Viltolarsen was well tolerated; no treatment-emergent adverse events required dose reduction, interruption, or discontinuation of the study drug. No serious adverse events or deaths occurred during the study.

Herein, long-term (>2 years) functional outcomes in viltolarsen treated patients were compared to a matched historical control group. To evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of the anti-sense oligonucleotide viltolarsen in the treatment of patients with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping therapy. This trial (NCT03167255) is the extension of a previously published 24-week trial in North America (NCT02740972) that examined dystrophin levels, timed function tests compared to a matched historical control group (Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group Duchenne Natural History Study, CINRG DNHS), and safety in boys 4 to\u200a<\u200a10 years (N\u200a=\u200a16) with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping who were treated with viltolarsen. Both groups were treated with glucocorticoids. All 16 participants elected to enroll in this long-term trial (up to 192 weeks) to continue evaluation of motor function and safety. Time to stand from supine and time to run/walk 10 meters showed stabilization from baseline through week 109 for viltolarsen-treated participants whereas the historical control group showed decline (statistically significant differences for multiple timepoints). Safety was similar to that observed in the previous 24-week trial, which was predominantly mild. There have been no treatment-related serious adverse events and no discontinuations. Based on these results at over 2 years, viltolarsen can be a new treatment option for patients with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"BACKGROUND: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, genetic disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene resulting in an absence of functional dystrophin protein.

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Cat eye syndrome (CES) is a rare chromosomal disease, with estimated incidence of about 1 in 100,000 live newborns. The classic triad of iris coloboma, anorectal malformations, and auricular abnormalities is present in 40% of patients, and other congenital defects may also be observed. The typical associated cytogenetic anomaly relies on an extra chromosome, derived from an inverted duplication of short arm and proximal long arm of chromosome 22, resulting in partial trisomy or tetrasomy of such regions (inv dup 22pter-22q11.2). We report on a full-term newborn, referred to us soon after birth. Physical examination showed facial dysmorphisms, including hypertelorism, down slanted palpebral fissures, and dysplastic ears with tragus hypoplasia and pre-auricular pit. Ophthalmologic evaluation and heart ultrasound identified left chorioretinal and iris coloboma and ostium secundum type atrial septal defect, respectively. Based on the suspicion of cat eye syndrome, a standard karyotype analysis was performed, and detected an extra small marker chromosome confirming the CES diagnosis. The chromosomal abnormality was then defined by array comparative genome hybridization (a-CGH, performed also in the parents), which identified the size of the rearrangement (3\u2009Mb), and its de novo occurrence. Postnatally, our newborn presented with persistent hypoglycemia and cholestatic jaundice. Endocrine tests revealed congenital hypothyroidism, cortisol and growth hormone (GH) deficiencies, which were treated with replacement therapies (levotiroxine and hydrocortisone). Brain magnetic resonance imaging, later performed, showed aplasia of the anterior pituitary gland, agenesis of the stalk and ectopic neurohypophysis, confirming the congenital hypopituitarism diagnosis. She was discharged at 2\u2009months of age, and included in a multidisciplinary follow-up. She currently is 7\u2009months old and shows a severe global growth failure, and developmental delay. She started GH replacement treatment, and continues oral hydrocortisone, along with ursodeoxycholic acid and levothyroxine, allowing an adequate control of glycemic and thyroid profiles as well as of cholestasis. CES phenotypic spectrum is wide and highly variable. Our report highlights how among the possible associated endocrine disorders, congenital hypopituitarism may occur, leading to persistent hypoglycemia and cholestasis. These patients should be promptly assessed for complete hormonal evaluations, in addition to major malformations and midline anomalies. Early recognition of such defects is necessary to decrease fatal events, as well as short and long-term related adverse outcomes.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"BACKGROUND: Cat eye syndrome (CES) is a rare chromosomal disease, with estimated incidence of about 1 in 100,000 live newborns.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural biological pathway that inhibits gene expression by targeted degradation or translational inhibition of cytoplasmic mRNA by the RNA induced silencing complex. RNAi has long been exploited in laboratory research to study the biological consequences of the reduced expression of a gene of interest. More recently RNAi has been demonstrated as a therapeutic avenue for rare metabolic diseases. This review presents an overview of the cellular RNAi machinery as well as therapeutic RNAi design and delivery. As a clinical example we present primary hyperoxaluria, an ultrarare inherited disease of increased hepatic oxalate production which leads to recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stones. In the most common form of the disease (Type 1), end-stage kidney disease occurs in childhood or young adulthood, often necessitating combined kidney and liver transplantation. In this context we discuss nedosiran (Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and lumasiran (Alnylam Pharmaceuticals), which are both novel RNAi therapies for primary hyperoxaluria that selectively reduce hepatic expression of lactate dehydrogenase and glycolate oxidase respectively, reducing hepatic oxalate production and urinary oxalate levels. Finally, we consider future optimizations advances in RNAi therapies.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"In this context we discuss nedosiran (Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and lumasiran (Alnylam Pharmaceuticals), which are both novel RNAi therapies for primary hyperoxaluria that selectively reduce hepatic expression of lactate dehydrogenase and glycolate oxidase respectively, reducing hepatic oxalate production and urinary oxalate levels.\"]}"}]}

Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is a rare genetic disease caused by hepatic overproduction of oxalate that leads to kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis, kidney failure, and systemic oxalosis. Lumasiran, an investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic agent, reduces hepatic oxalate production by targeting glycolate oxidase. In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) patients with PH1 who were 6 years of age or older to receive subcutaneous lumasiran or placebo for 6 months (with doses given at baseline and at months 1, 2, 3, and 6). The primary end point was the percent change in 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion from baseline to month 6 (mean percent change across months 3 through 6). Secondary end points included the percent change in the plasma oxalate level from baseline to month 6 (mean percent change across months 3 through 6) and the percentage of patients with 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion no higher than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range at month 6. A total of 39 patients underwent randomization; 26 were assigned to the lumasiran group and 13 to the placebo group. The least-squares mean difference in the change in 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion (lumasiran minus placebo) was -53.5 percentage points (P<0.001), with a reduction in the lumasiran group of 65.4% and an effect seen as early as month 1. The between-group differences for all hierarchically tested secondary end points were significant. The difference in the percent change in the plasma oxalate level (lumasiran minus placebo) was -39.5 percentage points (P<0.001). In the lumasiran group, 84% of patients had 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion no higher than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range at month 6, as compared with 0% in the placebo group (P<0.001). Mild, transient injection-site reactions were reported in 38% of lumasiran-treated patients. Lumasiran reduced urinary oxalate excretion, the cause of progressive kidney failure in PH1. The majority of patients who received lumasiran had normal or near-normal levels after 6 months of treatment.

Primary hyperoxalurias (PHs) are a group of inherited alterations of the hepatic glyoxylate metabolism. PHs classification based on gene mutations parallel a variety of enzymatic defects, and all involve the harmful accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals that produce systemic damage. These geographically widespread rare diseases have a deep impact in the life quality of the patients. Until recently, treatments were limited to palliative measures and kidney/liver transplants in the most severe forms. Efforts made to develop pharmacological treatments succeeded with the biotechnological agent lumasiran, a siRNA product against glycolate oxidase, which has become the first effective therapy to treat PH1. However, small molecule drugs have classically been preferred since they benefit from experience and have better pharmacological properties. The development of small molecule inhibitors designed against key enzymes of glyoxylate metabolism is on the focus of research. Enzyme inhibitors are successful and widely used in several diseases and their pharmacokinetic advantages are well known. In PHs, effective enzymatic targets have been determined and characterized for drug design and interesting inhibitory activities have been achieved both in vitro and in vivo. This review describes the most recent advances towards the development of small molecule enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of PHs, introducing the multi-target approach as a more effective and safe therapeutic option.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Efforts made to develop pharmacological treatments succeeded with the biotechnological agent lumasiran, a siRNA product against glycolate oxidase, which has become the first effective therapy to treat PH1.\"]}"}]}

Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is a rare genetic disease caused by excessive hepatic production and elevated urinary excretion of oxalate that leads to recurrent nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis and, eventually, kidney failure. As glomerular filtration rate declines, oxalate accumulates leading to systemic oxalosis, a debilitating condition with high morbidity and mortality. Although PH is usually diagnosed during infancy, it can present at any age with different phenotypes, ranging from mild symptoms to extremely debilitating manifestations. PH is an autosomal recessive disorder and, to date, three types have been identified: PH1, PH2 and PH3. PH1 is the most common and most aggressive type, accounting for almost 80% of primary hyperoxaluria diagnoses. Until 2020, general treatment for PH1 consisted mainly in high fluid intake, urine alkalization, surgical management of recurrent nephrolithiasis and eventually, if and when kidney failure occurred, intensive dialysis regimens and transplantation strategies (simultaneous or sequential liver-kidney transplant or isolated liver/kidney transplant in carefully selected patients). Specific treatment did and still consists in administration of pyridoxine hydrochloride, although it is only effective in a subset of PH1 patients. Lumasiran, a novel biological drug based on mRNA interference that has been recently approved in the US and European Union, showed promising results and is set to be a turning point in the management of PH1. This literature review aims to summarize the available evidence on PH1 treatment with lumasiran, in order to provide both pediatric and adult nephrologists and clinicians with the knowledge for the identification and management of PH1 patients suitable for treatment.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Lumasiran in the Management of Patients with Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1: From Bench to Bedside.\"]}"}]}

Lumasiran, a sub-cutaneous RNA-interference therapy, has been recently approved for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), with doses and intervals according to body weight. Little is known as to its use in infants; the aim of this study was to describe treatment outcome in 3 infants who received lumasiran therapy before 2\u00a0years of age. Patient 1 was diagnosed antenatally and received lumasiran from day 9. According to the product information template (PIT), he received monthly lumasiran (3 times at 6\u00a0mg/kg, then 3\u00a0mg/kg), with hyperhydration and potassium citrate. Despite decreased plasma oxalate levels, persistent normal kidney function, and good tolerance, kidney ultrasound performed after 2\u00a0months found nephrocalcinosis, without normalization of urinary oxalate (UOx). The dose was increased back to 6\u00a0mg/kg, inducing a normalization in UOx. Nephrocalcinosis started to improve at month 10. Patient 2 was diagnosed at 2.5\u00a0months (acute kidney failure); nephrocalcinosis was present from diagnosis. She received monthly lumasiran (6\u00a0mg/kg), with progressive decrease in UOx and substantial improvement in kidney function but stable nephrocalcinosis after 9 injections. Patient 3 was diagnosed fortuitously (nephrocalcinosis) at 3.5\u00a0months and received lumasiran before genetic diagnosis, leading to decreased UOx and maintenance of normal kidney function. Nephrocalcinosis improved after 5 injections. This report presents the youngest children treated with lumasiran worldwide. Lumasiran seems effective without side effects in infants but does not completely prevent the onset of nephrocalcinosis in the most severe forms. Higher doses than those proposed in the PIT might be required because of hepatic immaturity.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The effect of lumasiran therapy for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 in small infants.\"]}"}]}

Over the last few years, US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs using RNA interference have come to the market. Many have treated liver-specific diseases utilizing N-acetyl galactosamine conjugation because of its effective delivery and limited off-target effects. The autosomal recessive disorder primary hyperoxaluria, specifically type 1, has benefited from these developments. Primary hyperoxaluria arises from mutations in the enzymes involved in endogenous oxalate synthesis. The severity of disease varies but can result in kidney failure and systemic oxalosis. Until recently, the treatment options were limited and focused primarily on supportive treatments, pyridoxine use in a subset of patients with primary hyperoxaluria type 1, and liver-kidney transplants in those who progressed to kidney failure. Two genes have been targeted with RNA interference; lumasiran targets glycolate oxidase and nedosiran targets lactate dehydrogenase A. Lumasiran was recently approved in the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 and nedosiran is in the approval process. Unfortunately, despite initial hopes that nedosiran may also be a treatment option for primary hyperoxaluria types 2 and 3, initial data suggest otherwise. The use of RNA interference liver-specific targeting for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 will likely transform the natural history of the disease.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Lumasiran was recently approved in the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 and nedosiran is in the approval process.\"]}"}]}

In the rare disease primary hyperoxaluria type 1, overproduction of oxalate by the liver causes kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis, kidney failure, and systemic oxalosis. Lumasiran, an RNA interference therapeutic, suppresses glycolate oxidase, reducing hepatic oxalate production. The objective of this first-in-human, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles of lumasiran in healthy participants and patients with primary hyperoxaluria type 1. This phase 1/2 study was conducted in two parts. In part A, healthy adults randomized 3:1 received a single subcutaneous dose of lumasiran or placebo in ascending dose groups (0.3-6 mg/kg). In part B, patients with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 randomized 3:1 received up to three doses of lumasiran or placebo in cohorts of 1 or 3 mg/kg monthly or 3 mg/kg quarterly. Patients initially assigned to placebo crossed over to lumasiran on day 85. The primary outcome was incidence of adverse events. Secondary outcomes included pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, including measures of oxalate in patients with primary hyperoxaluria type 1. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Thirty-two healthy participants and 20 adult and pediatric patients with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 were enrolled. Lumasiran had an acceptable safety profile, with no serious adverse events or study discontinuations attributed to treatment. In part A, increases in mean plasma glycolate concentration, a measure of target engagement, were observed in healthy participants. In part B, patients with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 had a mean maximal reduction from baseline of 75% across dosing cohorts in 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion. All patients achieved urinary oxalate levels \u22641.5 times the upper limit of normal.

Multinational study; enrolled patients with PH1 of all ages, estimated glomerular filtration rate\u00a0\u226445 mL/min/1.73 m Lumasiran administered subcutaneously; 3 monthly doses followed by monthly or quarterly weight-based dosing. Primary end point: percent change in POx from baseline to month 6 (cohort A; not receiving hemodialysis at enrollment) and percent change in predialysis POx from baseline to month 6 (cohort B; receiving hemodialysis at enrollment). Pharmacodynamic secondary end points: percent change in POx area under the curve between dialysis sessions (cohort B only); absolute change in POx; percent and absolute change in spot urinary oxalate-creatinine ratio; and 24-hour urinary oxalate adjusted for body surface area. All patients (N\u00a0= 21; 43% female; 76% White) completed the 6-month primary analysis period. Median age at consent was 8 (range, 0-59) years. For the primary end point, least-squares mean reductions in POx were 33.3% (95% CI,\u00a0-15.2% to 81.8%) in cohort A (n\u00a0= 6) and 42.4% (95% CI, 34.2%-50.7%) in cohort B (n\u00a0= 15). Improvements were also observed in all pharmacodynamic secondary end points. Most adverse events were mild or moderate. No patient discontinued treatment or withdrew from the study. The most commonly reported lumasiran-related adverse events were injection-site reactions, all of which were mild and transient. Single-arm study without placebo control.

Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group.

Introduction: Asthma, along with inhaled steroids, was initially considered a risk factor for worse clinical outcomes in COVID-19. This was related to the higher morbidity observed in asthma patients during previous viral outbreaks. This retrospective study aimed at evaluating the prevalence of asthma among patients admitted due to SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the impact of inhaled therapies on their outcomes. Furthermore, a comparison between patients with asthma, COPD and the general population was made. Methods: All COVID-19 inpatients were recruited between February and July 2020 from four large hospitals in Northwest Italy. Data concerning medical history, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the hospital stay, including length, drugs and COVID-19 complications (respiratory failure, lung involvement, and the need for respiratory support) were collected, as well as the type of discharge. Results: patients with asthma required high-flow oxygen therapy (33.3 vs. 14.3%, p = 0.001) and invasive mechanical ventilation (17.9 vs. 9.5%, p = 0.048) more frequently when compared to the general population, but no other difference was observed. Moreover, asthma patients were generally younger than patients with COPD (59.2 vs. 76.8 years, p < 0.001), they showed both a lower mortality rate (15.4 vs. 39.4%, p < 0.001) and a lower CCI (3.4 vs. 6.2, p < 0.001). Patients with asthma in regular therapy with ICS at home had significantly shorter hospital stay compared to those with no treatments (25.2 vs. 11.3 days, p = 0.024). Discussion: Our study showed that asthma is not associated with worse outcomes of COVID-19, despite the higher need for respiratory support compared with the general population, while the use of ICS allowed for a shorter hospital stay. In addition, the comparison of asthma with COPD patients confirmed the greater frailty of the latter, according to their multiple comorbidities.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Our study showed that asthma is not associated with worse outcomes of COVID-19, despite the higher need for respiratory support compared with the general population, while the use of ICS allowed for a shorter hospital stay.\", \"Patients with asthma in regular therapy with ICS at home had significantly shorter hospital stay compared to those with no treatments (25.2 vs. 11.3 days, p = 0.024).\"]}"}]}

Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) are commonly prescribed to patients with severe COPD and recurrent exacerbations. It is not known what impact ICS cause in terms of COVID-19 positivity or disease severity in COPD. This study examined 27,810 patients with COPD from the Cleveland Clinic COVID-19 registry between March 8th and September 16th, 2020. Electronic health records were used to determine diagnosis of COPD, ICS use, and clinical outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for demographics, month of COVID-19 testing, and comorbidities known to be associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease. Amongst the COPD patients who were tested for COVID-19, 44.1% of those taking an ICS-containing inhaler tested positive for COVID-19 versus 47.2% who tested negative for COVID-19 (p = 0.033). Of those who tested positive for COVID-19 (n = 1288), 371 (28.8%) required hospitalization. In-hospital outcomes were not significantly different when comparing ICS versus no ICS in terms of ICU admission (36.8% [74/201] vs 31.2% [53/170], p = 0.30), endotracheal intubation (21.9% [44/201] vs 16.5% [28/170], p = 0.24), or mortality (18.4% [37/201] vs 20.0% [34/170], p = 0.80). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated no significant differences in hospitalization (adj OR 1.12, CI: 0.90-1.38), ICU admission (adj OR: 1.31, CI: 0.82-2.10), need for mechanical ventilation (adj OR 1.65, CI: 0.69-4.02), or mortality (OR: 0.80, CI: 0.43-1.49). In conclusion, ICS therapy did not increase COVID-19 related healthcare utilization or mortality outcome in patients with COPD followed at the Cleveland Clinic health system. These findings should encourage clinicians to continue ICS therapy for COPD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"These findings should encourage clinicians to continue ICS therapy for COPD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.\"]}"}]}

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread across the world. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the question of whether asthma is a risk factor for getting the infection or for poor outcomes motivated a great debate. In the field of severe asthma and its treatment during COVID-19 pandemic, several issues are also pending. A literature review focused on the management of severe asthma patients in the context of COVID-19 is performed. The available evidence suggests that severe asthma patients do not have an increased risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes and that it is safe to treat asthmatic patients with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and biologics during the pandemic, even though some studies indicate that high doses of ICS may predispose to COVID-19. The chronic use of oral corticosteroid (OCS) might be associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes, although there is no complete agreement. There is very limited evidence concerning the use of triple therapy for asthma in the context of this pandemic. Ultimately, severe asthma patients should maintain their medication during the COVID-19 pandemic, including biologic agents. More studies are needed to address the role of asthma medications and asthma's different phenotypes on the incidence and course of COVID-19.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" The available evidence suggests that severe asthma patients do not have an increased risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes and that it is safe to treat asthmatic patients with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and biologics during the pandemic, even though some studies indicate that high doses of ICS may predispose to COVID-19.\"]}"}]}

Awareness of the risk of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 makes patients hesitant about using inhaled medications that are considered as a potential source of viral transmission and immunosuppression. However, patients with asthma or COPD should continue all prescribed inhaled medications. Apparently, inhalers, including pMDIs, DPIs, or SMIs, have a low risk of contamination although characteristics of drug formulation can precipitate cough, whereas some researchers do not rule out the probability that nebulizer treatments may increase the risk of infection transmission via droplet nuclei and aerosols. Considering that aerosol therapy generates fugitive emissions that are not inhaled by the patient and are released from the device during expiration, several international professional bodies have provided recommendations for drug delivery via inhalers and in particular, nebulizers. Unfortunately, these recommendations are often in conflict with each other and do not clarify whether it is appropriate to use nebulizers during this COVID-19 pandemic. Considering what is available in literature, there are no known infection-related hazards to an uninfected patient and also a patient with COVID-19 that preclude the use of a nebulizer at home, but it fundamental that all patients, regardless of whether or not suffering from COVID-19, always follow some practical advices.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" However, patients with asthma or COPD should continue all prescribed inhaled medications.\", \"However, patients with asthma or COPD should continue all prescribed inhaled medications.\"]}"}]}

The effects of chronic inhaled and systemic corticosteroids use on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity are unclear. Since many patients with chronic pulmonary diseases rely on corticosteroids to control disease, it is important to understand the risks of their use during the pandemic. We aim to study if the use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids affects the likelihood of developing COVID-19 infection. We used the National Jewish Health electronic medical record research database to identify a cohort of all subjects who were tested for suspected COVID-19 between March 11 - June 23, 2020. Testing results, medication use, and comorbidities were obtained from the medical record. Following a comparison of different propensity score weighting methods, overlap propensity score weighting was used to analyze the association between medication use and COVID-19 diagnosis. The cohort consisted of 928 patients, of which 12% tested positive. The majority (66%) of patients had a history of chronic pulmonary diseases. There was no significant association between inhaled corticosteroid use and testing positive for COVID-19. Interestingly, systemic corticosteroid use was associated with a lower odds ratio (0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-0.99) of testing positive for COVID-19. Similar results were noted when the analysis was restricted to those with any chronic pulmonary diseases, with asthma or with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Our study supports the recommendation that patients with chronic pulmonary diseases, including asthma and COPD who require treatment with either inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, should continue their use during the COVID-19 pandemic.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Our study supports the recommendation that patients with chronic pulmonary diseases, including asthma and COPD who require treatment with either inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, should continue their use during the COVID-19 pandemic.\"]}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms.

Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The availability of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors has brought about a paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. BTK was clinically validated as a target by the efficacy of the first-in-class inhibitor ibrutinib. The extended survival conferred by BTK inhibitors has brought long-term tolerability to the foreground. To minimize toxicities thought to be attributable to off-target kinase inhibition, a next generation of BTK inhibitors with greater selectivity was developed. In the United States, zanubrutinib, a next-generation BTK inhibitor, has been approved for treating adults with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior therapy, for adults with Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia, and for adults with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma who have received at least one anti-CD20-based therapy. Because few head-to-head comparative trials of BTK inhibitors have so far been reported, no BTK 'inhibitor of choice' can be identified. Zanubrutinib has promising efficacy in its approved indications and appears to have reduced cardiac toxicities, particularly atrial fibrillation, which may influence the choice of BTK inhibitor treatment by prescribers. Further studies are needed to inform on optimal treatment sequencing of zanubrutinib and its combination with other agents. Here, we summarize existing clinical evidence for its efficacy and safety in mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia, marginal zone lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and other B-lymphoproliferative indications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"In the United States, zanubrutinib, a next-generation BTK inhibitor, has been approved for treating adults with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior therapy, for adults with Waldenstr\\u00c3\\u00b6m macroglobulinemia, and for adults with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma who have received at least one anti-CD20-based therapy.\"]}"}]}

Chart review Study 4658-405 (405) further followed these patients while receiving eteplirsen during usual clinical care. To compare long-term clinical outcomes of eteplirsen-treated patients from Studies 201/202/405 with those of external controls. Median total follow-up time was approximately 6 years of eteplirsen treatment. Outcomes included loss of ambulation (LOA) and percent-predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%p). Time to LOA was compared between eteplirsen-treated patients and standard of care (SOC) external controls and was measured from eteplirsen initiation in 201/202 or, in the SOC group, from the first study visit. Comparisons were conducted using univariate Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank tests, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models with regression adjustment for baseline characteristics. Annual change in FVC%p was compared between eteplirsen-treated patients and natural history study patients using linear mixed models with repeated measures. Data were included from all 12 patients in Studies 201/202 and the 10 patients with available data from 405. Median age at LOA was 15.16 years.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, X-linked, fatal, degenerative neuromuscular disease caused by DMD gene mutations. A relationship between exon skipping and dystrophin production in exon 51-amenable patients treated with eteplirsen (EXONDYS 51\u00ae) is established. Once-weekly eteplirsen significantly increased dystrophin, with slower decline in ambulatory function compared to baseline. Long-term treatment with eteplirsen leads to accumulation of dystrophin over time and observed functional benefits in patients with DMD. Compare long-term ambulatory function in eteplirsen-treated patients versus controls. Study 201/202 included 12 eteplirsen-treated patients assessed twice/year for ambulatory function over 4 years. Ambulatory evaluations (6-minute walk test [6MWT], loss of ambulation, and North Star Ambulatory Assessment [NSAA]) were compared with matched controls from Italian Telethon and Leuven registries.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Aggregated \u03b1-synuclein plays an important role in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Cinpanemab, a human-derived monoclonal antibody that binds to \u03b1-synuclein, is being evaluated as a disease-modifying treatment for Parkinson's disease. In a 52-week, multicenter, double-blind, phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 2:1:2:2 ratio, participants with early Parkinson's disease to receive intravenous infusions of placebo (control) or cinpanemab at a dose of 250 mg, 1250 mg, or 3500 mg every 4 weeks, followed by an active-treatment dose-blinded extension period for up to 112 weeks. The primary end points were the changes from baseline in the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) total score (range, 0 to 236, with higher scores indicating worse performance) at weeks 52 and 72. Secondary end points included MDS-UPDRS subscale scores and striatal binding as assessed on dopamine transporter single-photon-emission computed tomography (DaT-SPECT). Of the 357 enrolled participants, 100 were assigned to the control group, 55 to the 250-mg cinpanemab group, 102 to the 1250-mg group, and 100 to the 3500-mg group. The trial was stopped after the week 72 interim analysis owing to lack of efficacy. The change to week 52 in the MDS-UPDRS score was 10.8 points in the control group, 10.5 points in the 250-mg group, 11.3 points in the 1250-mg group, and 10.9 points in the 3500-mg group (adjusted mean difference vs. control, -0.3 points [95% confidence interval {CI}, -4.9 to 4.3], P\u2009=\u20090.90; 0.5 points [95% CI, -3.3 to 4.3], P\u2009=\u20090.80; and 0.1 point [95% CI, -3.8 to 4.0], P\u2009=\u20090.97, respectively). The adjusted mean difference at 72 weeks between participants who received cinpanemab through 72 weeks and the pooled group of those who started cinpanemab at 52 weeks was -0.9 points (95% CI, -5.6 to 3.8) for the 250-mg dose, 0.6 points (95% CI, -3.3 to 4.4) for the 1250-mg dose, and -0.8 points (95% CI, -4.6 to 3.0) for the 3500-mg dose. Results for secondary end points were similar to those for the primary end points. DaT-SPECT imaging at week 52 showed no differences between the control group and any cinpanemab group. The most common adverse events with cinpanemab were headache, nasopharyngitis, and falls.

The isolated perfused rat liver preparation was employed to study hepatic disposition of the model drug-carrier conjugate fluorescein-lactosylated albumin (F-LnHSA) with special reference to the influence of the organic anion fluorescein on liver cell specificity of the endocytosed neoglycoprotein. Hepatic clearance of fluoresceinated neoglycoproteins was significantly faster than clearance of radioiodinated neoglycoproteins. Perfusate clearance of F-L7HSA and F-L25HSA could not completely be inhibited by a dose of 10 mg asialoorosomucoid that saturates the hepatocyte receptor-mediated endocytic process. From these data, we inferred an additional hepatic uptake mechanism, competing with the Ashwell-receptor-mediated internalization of galactose-terminated glycoproteins. Clearance experiments with fluoresceinated 125I-human serum albumin in the presence of the polyanionic probe dextran sulfate revealed a nearly complete (approximately 90%) inhibition of hepatic uptake, while also a pronounced effect was obtained with colloidal carbon. These data point to nonparenchymal cell uptake of fluoresceinated protein via interaction with scavenger receptors. In wash-out studies, it was shown that about 25% of ligand sequestrated by sinusoidal liver cells escaped degradation and recycled to the perfusion medium. Our results show that care should be taken in the use of neoglycoproteins as drug carriers to hepatocytes, since a load of only 2 to 3 moles fluorescein per mole neoglycoprotein considerably affects intrahepatic distribution. The relative contribution of nonparenchymal cell uptake by coupling of acidic drugs to the neoglycoproteins is very probably inversely related to the number of exposing galactose groups per molecule neoglycoprotein. This phenomenon of \"inversed targeting\" could therapeutically both be useful or detrimental, dependent on the spectrum of cell types that should be reached by the drug.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"From these data, we inferred an additional hepatic uptake mechanism, competing with the Ashwell-receptor-mediated internalization of galactose-terminated glycoproteins. \"]}"}]}

Two types of models have recently been proposed to describe hepatic uptake kinetics of protein bound drugs: a model in which dissociation from plasma protein is rate limiting the process, and a model in which an interaction between protein and hepatocyte surface is thought to promote dissociation and uptake of the drug. This study was designed to investigate several aspects of both models, using lactosylated albumin as a binding protein that can interact with the Ashwell receptor abundantly present on the hepatocyte. Dibromosulfophthalein clearance was studied in rat liver in the presence of 150 microM (1%) albumin or 150 microM lactosylated albumin. Initial disappearance rate from perfusate in the presence of lactosylated albumin indicated a 2-fold decrease in hepatic uptake rate compared with native albumin. This was confirmed by compartmental analysis, showing a similar decrease in hepatic uptake rate constant. Protein binding of dibromosulfophthalein to lactosylated albumin was only marginally different from normal albumin. Consequently, modification of the protein retarded uptake of the organic anion at an essentially unchanged unbound concentration. Fluorescence spectroscopy of lactosylated albumin showed a blue-shifted tryptophan emission spectrum compared with albumin, indicating increased hydrophobicity of the neoglycoprotein. We therefore considered a change in off-and-on rate for binding of dibromosulfophthalein in lactosylated albumin. Rapid filtration experiments indicated that the dissociation rate constant of dibromosulfophthalein from lactosylated albumin was half that of controls. We conclude that the decreased off-rate from lactosylated albumin can explain the retarding influence on hepatic uptake rate of dibromosulfophthalein. This observation argues for the concept of dissociation-limited uptake in the hepatic clearance of the organic anion.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" This study was designed to investigate several aspects of both models, using lactosylated albumin as a binding protein that can interact with the Ashwell receptor abundantly present on the hepatocyte.\", \"This study was designed to investigate several aspects of both models, using lactosylated albumin as a binding protein that can interact with the Ashwell receptor abundantly present on the hepatocyte.\"]}"}]}

Background. The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) is a hepatic receptor that mediates removal of potentially hazardous glycoconjugates from blood in health and disease. The receptor comprises two proteins, asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 and 2 (ASGR1 and ASGR2), encoded by the genes ASGR1 and ASGR2. Design and Methods. Using reverse transcription amplification (RT-PCR), expression of ASGR1 and ASGR2 was investigated in human peripheral blood monocytes. Results. Monocytes were found to express ASGR1 and ASGR2 transcripts. Correctly spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms of ASGR1 and ASGR2 were present in monocytes. The profile of transcript variants from both ASGR1 and ASGR2 differed among individuals. Transcript expression levels were compared with the hepatocyte cell line HepG2 which produces high levels of ASGPR. Monocyte transcripts were 4 to 6 orders of magnitude less than in HepG2 but nonetheless readily detectable using standard RT-PCR. The monocyte cell line THP1 gave similar results to monocytes harvested from peripheral blood, indicating it may provide a suitable model system for studying ASGPR function in this cell type. Conclusions. Monocytes transcribe and correctly process transcripts encoding the constituent proteins of the ASGPR. Monocytes may therefore represent a mobile pool of the receptor, capable of reaching sites remote from the liver.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) is a hepatic receptor that mediates removal of potentially hazardous glycoconjugates from blood in health and disease.

The Ashwell receptor, the major lectin of hepatocytes, rapidly clears from blood circulation glycoproteins bearing glycan ligands that include galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine. This asialoglycoprotein receptor activity remains a key factor in the development and administration of glycoprotein pharmaceuticals, yet a biological purpose of the Ashwell receptor has remained elusive. We have identified endogenous ligands of the Ashwell receptor as glycoproteins and regulatory components in blood coagulation and thrombosis that include von Willebrand factor (vWF) and platelets. The Ashwell receptor normally modulates vWF homeostasis and is responsible for thrombocytopenia during systemic Streptococcus pneumoniae infection by eliminating platelets desialylated by the bacterium's neuraminidase. Hemostatic adaptation by the Ashwell receptor moderates the onset and severity of disseminated intravascular coagulation during sepsis and improves the probability of host survival.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The Ashwell receptor, the major lectin of hepatocytes, rapidly clears from blood circulation glycoproteins bearing glycan ligands that include galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine\", \"The Ashwell receptor, the major lectin of hepatocytes, rapidly clears from blood circulation glycoproteins bearing glycan ligands that include galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine.\"]}"}]}

The Ashwell-Morell receptor (AMR) of hepatocytes, originally termed the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor, was the first cellular receptor to be identified and isolated and the first lectin to be detected in mammals. It is one of the multiple lectins of the C-type lectin family involved in recognition, binding, and clearance of asialoglycoproteins. We recently identified endogenous ligands of the AMR as desialylated prothrombotic components, including platelets and von Willebrand Factor [Ellies L. G., Ditto D., Levy G.

The endocytic Ashwell-Morell receptor (AMR) of hepatocytes detects pathogen remodeling of host glycoproteins by neuraminidase in the bloodstream and mitigates the lethal coagulopathy of sepsis. We have investigated the mechanism of host protection by the AMR during the onset of sepsis and in response to the desialylation of blood glycoproteins by the NanA neuraminidase of Streptococcus pneumoniae. We find that the AMR selects among potential glycoprotein ligands unmasked by microbial neuraminidase activity in pneumococcal sepsis to eliminate from blood circulation host factors that contribute to coagulation and thrombosis. This protection is attributable in large part to the rapid induction of a moderate thrombocytopenia by the AMR. We further show that neuraminidase activity in the blood can be manipulated to induce the clearance of AMR ligands including platelets, thereby preactivating a protective response in pneumococcal sepsis that moderates the severity of disseminated intravascular coagulation and enables host survival. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The endocytic Ashwell-Morell receptor (AMR) of hepatocytes detects pathogen remodeling of host glycoproteins by neuraminidase in the bloodstream and mitigates the lethal coagulopathy of sepsis.\"]}"}]}

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common bleeding disorder caused primarily by autoantibodies against platelet GPIIbIIIa and/or the GPIb complex. Current theory suggests that antibody-mediated platelet destruction occurs in the spleen, via macrophages through Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions. However, we and others have demonstrated that anti-GPIb\u03b1 (but not GPIIbIIIa)-mediated ITP is often refractory to therapies targeting Fc\u03b3R pathways. Here, we generate mouse anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize GPIb\u03b1 and GPIIbIIIa of different species. Utilizing these unique mAbs and human ITP plasma, we find that anti-GPIb\u03b1, but not anti-GPIIbIIIa antibodies, induces Fc-independent platelet activation, sialidase neuraminidase-1 translocation and desialylation. This leads to platelet clearance in the liver via hepatocyte Ashwell-Morell receptors, which is fundamentally different from the classical Fc-Fc\u03b3R-dependent macrophage phagocytosis. Importantly, sialidase inhibitors ameliorate anti-GPIb\u03b1-mediated thrombocytopenia in mice. These findings shed light on Fc-independent cytopenias, designating desialylation as a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in the treatment of refractory ITP. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"This leads to platelet clearance in the liver via hepatocyte Ashwell-Morell receptors, which is fundamentally different from the classical Fc-Fc\\u00ce\\u00b3R-dependent macrophage phagocytosis.\"]}"}]}

The mammalian asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) is located on the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes where it binds and endocytoses galactose-terminated glycoproteins (asialoglycoproteins). ASGPR is composed of two highly homologous subunits, termed hepatic lectin 1 and 2. Despite numerous studies the contribution of both subunits to biosynthesis and functional activity of ASGPR in vivo has remained controversial. Mice lacking the murine hepatic lectin (MHL)-2 subunit are viable and fertile without obvious phenotypic abnormalities. In the absence of MHL-2, knockout mice express MHL-1 protein at reduced levels. Here, we examine the intracellular fate and function of this remaining subunit. The results show that MHL-1 reaches the hepatocellular surface in knockout mice but is unable to effectively remove any one of three different radiolabeled ligands within 30 min. A small but detectable residual ligand clearance in knockout mice at 4 h is apparently not mediated by remaining MHL-1. Serum concentrations of galactose-terminating glycoproteins are not elevated in these ASGPR-deficient mice. However, competitive in vitro degradation experiments suggest that other endogenous ASGPR ligands, the nature of which remain to be determined, accumulate in serum of knockout animals.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The mammalian asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) is located on the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes where it binds and endocytoses galactose-terminated glycoproteins (asialoglycoproteins).

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects.

These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant.

Histones function both positively and negatively in the regulation of gene expression, mainly governed by post-translational modifications on specific amino acid residues. Although histone modifications are not necessarily prerequisite codes, they may still serve as good epigenetic indicators of chromatin state associated with gene activation or repression. In particular, six emerging classes of histone H3 modifications are subjected for epigenome profiling by the International Human Epigenome Consortium. In general, transcription start sites of actively transcribed genes are marked by trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me3) and acetylated H3K27 (H3K27ac), and active enhancers can be identified by enrichments of both monomethylated H3K4 (H3K4me1) and H3K27ac. Gene bodies of actively transcribed genes are associated with trimethylated H3K36 (H3K36me3). Gene repression can be mediated through two distinct mechanisms involving trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me3) and trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3). Enrichments of these histone modifications on specific loci, or in genome wide, in given cells can be analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based methods using an antibody directed against the site-specific modification. When performing ChIP experiments, one should be careful about the specificity of antibody, as this affects the data interpretation.

We hypothesized \"seesaw\" dynamics between H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 in the low and intermediate DNA methylation range, in which DNA methylation discriminates between enhancers and promoters, marked by H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, respectively. Low methylated regions are H3K4me3 enriched, while those with intermediate DNA methylation levels are progressively H3K4me1 enriched. Additionally, the enrichment of H3K27ac, distinguishing active from primed enhancers, follows a plateau in the lower range of the intermediate DNA methylation level, corresponding to active enhancers, and decreases linearly in the higher range of the intermediate DNA methylation. Thus, the decrease of the DNA methylation switches smoothly the state of the enhancers from a primed to an active state. We summarize these observations into a rule of thumb of one-out-of-three methylation marks: \"In each genomic region only one out of these three methylation marks {DNA methylation, H3K4me1, H3K4me3} is high. If it is the DNA methylation, the region is inactive. If it is H3K4me1, the region is an enhancer, and if it is H3K4me3, the region is a promoter\". To test our model, we used available genome-wide datasets of H3K4 methyltransferases knockouts. Our analysis suggests that CXXC proteins, as readers of non-methylated CpGs would regulate the \"seesaw\" mechanism that focuses H3K4me3 to unmethylated sites, while being repulsed from H3K4me1 decorated enhancers and CpG island shores. Our results show that DNA methylation discriminates promoters from enhancers through H3K4me1-H3K4me3 seesaw mechanism, and suggest its possible function in the inheritance of chromatin marks after cell division. Our analyses suggest aberrant formation of promoter-like regions and ectopic transcription of hypomethylated regions of DNA. Such mechanism process can have important implications in biological process in where it has been reported abnormal DNA methylation status such as cancer and aging.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"DNA methylation at promoters is largely correlated with inhibition of gene expression.

Combinations of post-translational histone modifications shape the chromatin landscape during cell development in eukaryotes. However, little is known about the modifications exactly delineating functionally engaged regulatory elements. For example, although histone H3 lysine 4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) indicates the presence of transcriptional gene enhancers, it does not provide clearcut information about their actual position and stage-specific activity. Histone marks were, therefore, studied here at genomic loci differentially expressed in early stages of T-lymphocyte development. The concomitant presence of the three H3K4 methylation states (H3K4me1/2/3) was found to clearly reflect the activity of bona fide T-cell gene enhancers. Globally, gain or loss of H3K4me2/3 at distal genomic regions correlated with, respectively, the induction or the repression of associated genes during T-cell development. In the Tcrb gene enhancer, the H3K4me3-to-H3K4me1 ratio decreases with the enhancer's strength. Lastly, enhancer association of RNA-polymerase II (Pol II) correlated with the presence of H3K4me3 and Pol II accumulation resulted in local increase of H3K4me3.

The generation of distinctive cell types that form different tissues and organs requires precise, temporal and spatial control of gene expression. This depends on specific cis-regulatory elements distributed in the noncoding DNA surrounding their target genes.

Enhancers act to regulate cell-type-specific gene expression by facilitating the transcription of target genes. In mammalian cells, active or primed enhancers are commonly marked by monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) in a cell-type-specific manner. Whether and how this histone modification regulates enhancer-dependent transcription programs in mammals is unclear. In this study, we conducted SILAC mass spectrometry experiments with mononucleosomes and identified multiple H3K4me1-associated proteins, including many involved in chromatin remodeling. We demonstrate that H3K4me1 augments association of the chromatin-remodeling complex BAF to enhancers in vivo and that, in vitro, H3K4me1-marked nucleosomes are more efficiently remodeled by the BAF complex. Crystal structures of the BAF component BAF45C indicate that monomethylation, but not trimethylation, is accommodated by BAF45C's H3K4-binding site. Our results suggest that H3K4me1 has an active role at enhancers by facilitating binding of the BAF complex and possibly other chromatin regulators.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"In mammalian cells, active or primed enhancers are commonly marked by monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) in a cell-type-specific manner.\"]}"}]}

Enhancers play a pivotal role in regulating the transcription of distal genes. Although certain chromatin features, such as the histone acetyltransferase P300 and the histone modification H3K4me1, indicate the presence of enhancers, only a fraction of enhancers are functionally active. Individual chromatin marks, such as H3K27ac and H3K27me3, have been identified to distinguish active from inactive enhancers. However, the systematic identification of the most informative single modification, or combination thereof, is still lacking. Furthermore, the discovery of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) provides an alternative approach to directly predicting enhancer activity. However, it remains challenging to link chromatin modifications to eRNA transcription. Herein, we develop a logistic regression model to unravel the relationship between chromatin modifications and eRNA synthesis. We perform a systematic assessment of 24 chromatin modifications in fetal lung fibroblast and demonstrate that a combination of four modifications is sufficient to accurately predict eRNA transcription. Furthermore, we compare the ability of eRNAs and H3K27ac to discriminate enhancer activity. We demonstrate that eRNA is more indicative of enhancer activity. Finally, we apply our fibroblast trained model to six other cell-types and successfully predict eRNA synthesis. Thus, we demonstrate the learned relationships are general and independent of cell-type. We provided a powerful tool to identify active enhancers and reveal the relationship between chromatin modifications, eRNA production and enhancer activity. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Although certain chromatin features, such as the histone acetyltransferase P300 and the histone modification H3K4me1, indicate the presence of enhancers, only a fraction of enhancers are functionally active.\"]}"}]}

The integrated activity of cis-regulatory elements fine-tunes transcriptional programs of mammalian cells by recruiting cell type-specific as well as ubiquitous transcription factors (TFs). Despite their key role in modulating transcription, enhancers are still poorly characterized at the molecular level, and their limited DNA sequence conservation in evolution and variable distance from target genes make their unbiased identification challenging. The coexistence of high mono-methylation and low tri-methylation levels of lysine 4 of histone H3 is considered a signature of enhancers, but a comprehensive view of histone modifications associated to enhancers is still lacking. By combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with mass spectrometry, we investigated cis-regulatory regions in macrophages to comprehensively identify histone marks specifically associated with enhancers, and to profile their dynamics after transcriptional activation elicited by an inflammatory stimulation. The intersection of the proteomics data with ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses revealed the existence of novel subpopulations of enhancers, marked by specific histone modification signatures: specifically, H3K4me1/K36me2 marks transcribed enhancers, while H3K4me1/K36me3 and H3K4me1/K79me2 combinations mark distinct classes of intronic enhancers. Thus, our MS analysis of functionally distinct genomic regions revealed the combinatorial code of histone modifications, highlighting the potential of proteomics in addressing fundamental questions in epigenetics.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The coexistence of high mono-methylation and low tri-methylation levels of lysine 4 of histone H3 is considered a signature of enhancers, but a comprehensive view of histone modifications associated to enhancers is still lacking.\"]}"}]}

During tissue development, transcription factors bind regulatory DNA regions called enhancers, often located at great distances from the genes they regulate, to control gene expression. The enhancer landscape during embryonic stem cell differentiation has been well characterized. By contrast, little is known about the shared and unique enhancer regulatory mechanisms in different ectodermally derived epithelial cells. Here we use ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify domains enriched for the histone marks histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation, histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation, and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac) and define, for the first time, the super enhancers and typical enhancers active in primary human corneal epithelial cells. We show that regulatory regions are often shared between cell types of the ectodermal lineage and that corneal epithelial super enhancers are already marked as potential regulatory domains in embryonic stem cells. Kruppel-like factor (KLF) motifs were enriched in corneal epithelial enhancers, consistent with the important roles of KLF4 and KLF5 in promoting corneal epithelial differentiation. We now show that the Kruppel family member KLF7 promotes the corneal progenitor cell state; on many genes, KLF7 antagonized the corneal differentiation-promoting KLF4. Furthermore, we found that two SNPs linked previously to corneal diseases, astigmatism, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome fall within corneal epithelial enhancers and alter their activity by disrupting transcription factor motifs that overlap these SNPs. Taken together, our work defines regulatory enhancers in corneal epithelial cells, highlights global gene-regulatory relationships shared among different epithelial cells, identifies a role for KLF7 as a KLF4 antagonist in corneal epithelial cell differentiation, and explains how two SNPs may contribute to corneal diseases.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Here we use ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify domains enriched for the histone marks histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation, histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation, and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac) and define, for the first time, the super enhancers and typical enhancers active in primary human corneal epithelial cells.\"]}"}]}

Developmental programs are controlled by transcription factors and chromatin regulators, which maintain specific gene expression programs through epigenetic modification of the genome. These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential for differentiation into new cell types. Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs.

Analysis of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) by mass spectrometry (MS) has become a fundamental tool for the characterization of chromatin composition and dynamics. Histone PTMs benchmark several biological states of chromatin, including regions of active enhancers, active/repressed gene promoters and damaged DNA. These complex regulatory mechanisms are often defined by combinatorial histone PTMs; for instance, active enhancers are commonly occupied by both marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac. The traditional bottom-up MS strategy identifies and quantifies short (aa 4-20) tryptic peptides, and it is thus not suitable for the characterization of combinatorial PTMs. Areas covered: Here, we review the advancement of the middle-down MS strategy applied to histones, which consists in the analysis of intact histone N-terminal tails (aa 50-60). Middle-down MS has reached sufficient robustness and reliability, and it is far less technically challenging than PTM quantification on intact histones (top-down). However, the very few chromatin biology studies applying middle-down MS resulting from PubMed searches indicate that it is still very scarcely exploited, potentially due to the apparent high complexity of method and analysis. Expert commentary: We will discuss the state-of-the-art workflow and examples of existing studies, aiming to highlight its potential and feasibility for studies of cell biologists interested in chromatin and epigenetics.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"These complex regulatory mechanisms are often defined by combinatorial histone PTMs; for instance, active enhancers are commonly occupied by both marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac.\"]}"}]}

Genome-wide association studies have identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with increased risk for intracranial aneurysm (IA). However, how such variants affect gene expression within IA is poorly understood. We used publicly-available ChIP-Seq data to study chromatin landscapes surrounding risk loci to determine whether IA-associated SNPs affect functional elements that regulate gene expression in cell types comprising IA tissue. We mapped 16 significant IA-associated SNPs to linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks within human genome. Using ChIP-Seq data, we examined these regions for presence of H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and H3K9ac histone marks (typically associated with latent/active enhancers). This analysis was conducted in several cell types that are present in IA tissue (endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, T cells, B cells, NK cells). In cell types with significant histone enrichment, we used HiC data to investigate topologically associated domains (TADs) encompassing the LD blocks to identify genes that may be affected by IA-associated variants. Bioinformatics were performed to determine the biological significance of these genes. Genes within HiC-defined TADs were also compared to differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq/microarray studies of IA tissues. We found that endothelial cells and fibroblasts, rather than smooth muscle or immune cells, have significant enrichment for enhancer marks on IA risk haplotypes (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Bioinformatics demonstrated that genes within TADs subsuming these regions are associated with structural extracellular matrix components and enzymatic activity. The majority of histone marked TADs (83% fibroblasts [IMR90], 77% HUVEC) encompassed at least one differentially expressed gene from IA tissue studies. These findings provide evidence that genetic variants associated with IA risk act on endothelial cells and fibroblasts. There is strong circumstantial evidence that this may be mediated through altered enhancer function, as genes in TADs encompassing enhancer marks have also been shown to be differentially expressed in IA tissue. These genes are largely related to organization and regulation of the extracellular matrix. This study builds upon our previous (Poppenberg et al., BMC Med Genomics, 2019) by including a more diverse set of data from additional cell types and by identifying potential affected genes (i.e. those in TADs).```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Using ChIP-Seq data, we examined these regions for presence of H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and H3K9ac histone marks (typically associated with latent/active enhancers).\"]}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms.

An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57).

The detection of EGFR mutations in circulating cell-free DNA can enable personalized therapy for cancer. The current techniques for detecting circulating EGFR mutations are expensive and time-consuming with moderate sensitivity. Emerging CRISPR is revolutionizing medical diagnostics and showing a great promise for nucleic acid detection. This study aims to develop CRISPR-Cas12a as a simple test to sensitively detect circulating EGFR mutations in plasma. Serially diluted samples of DNA containing heterozygous EGFR mutations (L858R and T790M) in wild-type genomic DNA are concurrently tested for the mutations by a CRISPR-Cas12a system and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The CRISPR-Cas12a system can detect both L858R and T790M with a limit of detection of 0.005% in less than three hours. ddPCR detects the mutations with a limit of detection of 0.05% for more than five hours. Plasma samples of 28 lung cancer patients and 20 cancer-free individuals are tested for the EGFR mutations by CRISPR-Cas12a system and ddPCR. The CRISPR-Cas12a system could detect L858R in plasma of two lung cancer patients whose tissue biopsies are positive for L858R, and one plasma sample of three lung cancer patients whose tissue biopsies are positive for T790M. ddPCR detects L858R in the same two plasm samples, however, does not detect T790M in any of the plasma samples.

CIS43 is a potent neutralizing human mAb that targets a highly conserved \"junctional\" epitope in the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP). Enhancing the durability of CIS43 in vivo will be important for clinical translation. Here, 2 approaches were used to improve the durability of CIS43 in vivo while maintaining potent neutralization. First, the Fc domain was modified with the LS mutations (CIS43LS) to increase CIS43 binding affinity for the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). CIS43LS and CIS43 showed comparable in vivo protective efficacy. CIS43LS had 9- to 13-fold increased binding affinity for human (6.2 nM versus 54.2 nM) and rhesus (25.1 nM versus 325.8 nM) FcRn at endosomal pH 6.0 compared with CIS43. Importantly, the half-life of CIS43LS in rhesus macaques increased from 22 days to 39 days compared with CIS43. The second approach for sustaining antibody levels of CIS43 in vivo is through adeno-associated virus (AAV) expression. Mice administered once with AAV-expressing CIS43 had sustained antibody levels of approximately 300 \u03bcg/mL and mediated protection against sequential malaria challenges up to 36 weeks. Based on these data, CIS43LS has advanced to phase I clinical trials, and AAV delivery provides a potential next-generation approach for malaria prevention.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Based on these data, CIS43LS has advanced to phase I clinical trials, and AAV delivery provides a potential next-generation approach for malaria prevention.\"]}"}]}

To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN.

Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found.

RNA polymerases initiate transcription at DNA sequences called promoters. In bacteria, the best conserved promoter feature is the AT-rich -10 element; a sequence essential for DNA unwinding. Further elements, and gene regulatory proteins, are needed to recruit RNA polymerase to the -10 sequence. Hence, -10 elements cannot function in isolation. Many horizontally acquired genes also have a high AT-content. Consequently, sequences that resemble the -10 element occur frequently. As a result, foreign genes are predisposed to spurious transcription. However, it is not clear how RNA polymerase initially recognizes such sequences. Here, we identify a non-canonical promoter element that plays a key role. The sequence, itself a short AT-tract, resides 5 base pairs upstream of otherwise cryptic -10 elements. The AT-tract alters DNA conformation and enhances contacts between the DNA backbone and RNA polymerase.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"RNA polymerases initiate transcription at DNA sequences called promoters.\"]}"}]}

Here, we describe experiments to determine whether the prototype T7 RNAP is able to recognize and initiate at truncated promoters similar to mitochondrial promoters. Using an in vitro oligonucleotide transcriptional system, we have assayed transcription initiation activity by T7 RNAP. These assays have not only defined the limits of conventional de novo initiation on truncated promoters, but have identified novel activities of initiation of RNA synthesis.

The c-myc promoter is regulated by scores of signals, transcription factors, and chromatin components. The logic integrating these multiple signals remains unexplored. Recent evidence suggests that activated MYC expression is regulated in several phases: 1) conventional transcription factors trigger transcription by the RNA polymerase II (pol II) paused within the proximal promoter region. Concurrently (and probably consequently), newly arrived chromatin-remodeling complexes mobilize a nucleosome masking the far upstream element (FUSE), 1.7-kb upstream of the P2 start site; 2) binding by FUSE-binding proteins (first FBP3, then FBP); and 3) FBP-interacting repressor (FIR) binds FUSE and returns transcription to basal or steady-state levels. The recruitment and release of the FBPs and FIR is governed by FUSE-DNA conformation, itself controlled by dynamic supercoils propagated behind pol II. The organization and operation of the c-myc promoter make it difficult to inactivate, but sensitive to disturbances (translocations, viral insertions, amplification, and mutation) that disrupt the fine-tuning seen at its normal chromosomal context.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"conventional transcription factors trigger transcription by the RNA polymerase II (pol II) paused within the proximal promoter region.\"]}"}]}

Binding of polymerase to this site, termed P3, occurs simultaneous to its binding at P1/P2. We have located this P3 site by DNase I footprinting. A 63 base pair region centered around position - 100 with respect to galP1 is protected by polymerase. Interestingly, a Pribnow box TATAAT is present within this protected region (-103 to -108). We have shown that transcription occurs from P3 in vitro. Primer extension analysis provides direct evidence that P3 is transcribed in vivo. The start site of transcription has been mapped at -96 position relative to galP1. beta-galactosidase assays with different gal promoter constructs reveal that while P3 alone functions as a weak in vivo promoter, it has a synergistic effect on transcription from the gal operon, since deletion of P3 or specifically mutating its -10 region result in a substantial reduction in the gal promoter activity.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"RNA polymerase is known to bind and utilize the overlapping promoters P1 and P2 in Escherichia coli galactose operon.

To identify an archaebacterial promoter sequence, nuclease protection studies with the purified RNA polymerase of Methanococcus vannielii were performed. The enzyme binds specifically both at protein-encoding (hisA and methyl CoM reductase, component C) and tRNA-rRNA genes. The binding region of the RNA polymerase extends from 30 base pairs (bp) upstream (-30) to 20 bp downstream (+20) from the in vivo transcription start site. This finding indicates that the archaebacterial enzyme recognizes promoters without transacting transcription factors. The DNA segment protected from nuclease digestion by bound RNA polymerase contains an octanucleotide sequence centered at -25, which is conserved between the protein-encoding and the stable RNA genes. According to the specific binding of the enzyme to only DNA-fragments harbouring this motif, we propose the sequence TTTATATA as the major recognition signal of the Methanococcus RNA polymerase. Comparison of this motif with published archaebacterial DNA sequences revealed the presence of homologous sequences at the same location upstream of 36 genes. We therefore consider the overall consensus TTTATAATA as a general element of promoters in archaebacteria. In spite of the specific binding of the enzyme, most preparations of the Methanococcus vannielii RNA polymerase are unable to initiate transcription at the correct sites in vitro.

RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II) is recruited to core promoters by the pre-initiation complex (PIC) of general transcription factors. Within the PIC, transcription factor for RNA polymerase IIB (TFIIB) determines the start site of transcription. TFIIB binding has not been localized, genome-wide, in metazoans. Serial analysis of chromatin occupancy (SACO) is an unbiased methodology used to empirically identify transcription factor binding regions. In this report, we use TFIIB and SACO to localize TFIIB binding regions across the rat genome. A sample of the TFIIB SACO library was sequenced and 12,968 TFIIB genomic signature tags (GSTs) were assigned to the rat genome. GSTs are 20-22 base pair fragments that are derived from TFIIB bound chromatin. TFIIB localized to both non-protein coding and protein-coding loci. For 21% of the 1783 protein-coding genes in this sample of the SACO library, TFIIB binding mapped near the characterized 5' promoter that is upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). However, internal TFIIB binding positions were identified in 57% of the 1783 protein-coding genes. Internal positions are defined as those within an inclusive region greater than 2.5 kb downstream from the 5' TSS and 2.5 kb upstream from the transcription stop. We demonstrate that both TFIIB and TFIID (an additional component of PICs) bound to internal regions using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The 5' cap of transcripts associated with internal TFIIB binding positions were identified using a cap-trapping assay. The 5' TSSs for internal transcripts were confirmed by primer extension. Additionally, an analysis of the functional annotation of mouse 3 (FANTOM3) databases indicates that internally initiated transcripts identified by TFIIB SACO in rat are conserved in mouse. Our findings that TFIIB binding is not restricted to the 5' upstream region indicates that the propensity for PIC to contribute to transcript diversity is far greater than previously appreciated.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"BACKGROUND: RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II) is recruited to core promoters by the pre-initiation complex (PIC) of general transcript\"]}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder, that is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and loss of ambulation between 7-13 years of age. Novel pharmacological agents targeting the genetic defects and disease mechanisms are becoming available; however, corticosteroid (CS) therapy remains the standard of care. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to elucidate the effect of CS therapy on the rate of muscle strength and gross motor skill decline in boys with DMD and assess the sensitivity of selected outcome measures. Eighty-four ambulatory boys with DMD (49-180 months), 70 on CS, 14 corticosteroid na\u00efve (NCS), participated in this 8-year multi-site study. Outcomes included; isokinetic dynamometry, the Standing (STD) and Walking/Running/jumping (WRJ) dimensions of the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM), and Timed Function Tests (TFTs). Nonlinear mixed modeling procedures determined the rate of change with age and the influence of steroids. Despite CS therapy the rate of decline in strength with age was significant in all muscle groups assessed. CS therapy significantly slowed decline in knee extensor strength, as the NCS group declined at 3x the rate of the CS group. Concurrently, WRJ skills declined in the NCS group at twice the rate of the CS group. 4-stair climb and 10 meter walk/run performance was superior in the boys on CS therapy. CS therapy slowed the rate of muscle strength decline and afforded longer retention of select gross motor skills in boys on CS compared to boys who were NCS. Isokinetic dynamometry, Walk/Run/Jump skills, and select TFTs may prove informative in assessing the efficacy of new therapeutics in ambulatory boys with DMD.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder, that is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and loss of ambulation between 7-13 years of age.\"]}"}]}

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most frequent genetic neuromuscular disease in childhood with loss of ambulation usually occurring around the age of 9-11\u00a0years. Based on current guidelines and clinical trials, neuropediatric and neurological experts developed recommendations for the treatment of nonambulatory DMD patients focusing on drug treatment of adults. This advisory board was sponsored by PTC Therapeutics, the distributers of the substance ataluren. Loss of ambulation is heterogeneously defined across clinical trials. Among others, the need of a\u00a0wheelchair, ambulation without mobility aids or maximum walking distance can be suitable parameters for assessment. Treatment of DMD patients at any stage of the disease is based on supportive and symptomatic measures, which should be continued after loss of ambulation. In addition, disease-modifying drugs are available for the treatment of DMD and glucocorticoids are the usual standard of care treatment even beyond the loss of ambulation. Ataluren, a\u00a0potentially dystrophin restorative, disease-modifying treatment, has been approved for patients with DMD due to a\u00a0nonsense mutation (nmDMD), which applies to approximately 13% of DMD patients and is usually combined with steroids. Clinical data from the STRIDE registry demonstrated a\u00a0delayed disease progression even after loss of ambulation. Currently, no reliable data are available for exon skipping approaches in adult DMD patients. The antioxidant idebenone could be an option in nonambulant adolescent patients not treated with glucocorticoids and without other therapeutic options. A\u00a0combination treatment of idebenone and glucocorticoids is currently being investigated in a\u00a0clinical trial. Add-on treatment with idebenone in addition to ataluren may be considered for nonambulant nmDMD patients. Some of the discussed treatment options are still in clinical trials or there are not enough data for older DMD patients; therefore, these expert recommendations correspond to evidence class\u00a0IV.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"BACKGROUND: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most frequent genetic neuromuscular disease in childhood with loss of ambulation usually occurring around the age of 9-11\\u00c2\\u00a0years.OBJECTIVE, MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on current guidelines and clinical trials, neuropediatric and neurological experts developed recommendations for the treatment of nonambulatory DMD p\", \" childhood with loss of ambulation usually occurring around the age of 9-11\\u00c2\\u00a0years.OBJECTIVE, MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on current guidelines and cli\"]}"}]}

Ischial weight-bearing knee ankle foot orthoses prolong ambulation for 2-3 years. We report the outcome of the ambulatory status of a patient with DMD treated with daily steroid therapy and orthoses. This male patient was diagnosed with DMD at age of 2. He has been treated with daily steroids since age 7 years. He lost the ability to arise from the floor and walk up steps at age 14 and lost ambulation by age 16. He was fitted with orthoses at age 16 following surgical correction of his lower extremity contractures and regained independent ambulation. At age 20, he was able to stand independently in his orthoses and take steps with moderate support. We conclude that a combination of daily steroids and orthoses prolongs ambulation beyond that of the natural history DMD.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) lose ambulation by age 12.\"]}"}]}

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common and most severe form of childhood muscular dystrophies, resulting in early loss of ambulation between the ages of 7 and 13 years and death in the teens and twenties. Despite the phenomenal advances made in the understanding of the molecular genetics of the disease, no definitive cure has been found. Of all of the therapeutic drugs studied in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, only prednisone seems to have the potential for providing interim functional improvement for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy while they wait for a cure with gene or cell therapy. There is still no consensus regarding recommending corticosteroids as standard therapy for boys. This is an evidence-based review of all of the studies of corticosteroids (prednisone, deflazacort, and oxandrolone) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. From this review, it is clear that until a definitive treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is available, the use of deflazacort and prednisone with judicious dietary control and close clinical monitoring for side effects seems the best intervention for interim preservation of function in such a common devastating disorder of young growing boys.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common and most severe form of childhood muscular dystrophies, resulting in early loss of ambulation between the ages of 7 and 13 years and death in the teens and twenties.\", \"trophies, resulting in early loss of ambulation between the ages of 7 and 13 years and death in the teens and twenties.

Two hundred and thirteen of 428 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) of a prospective and open study were operated on bilaterally with hip and knee release, aponeurectomy of the iliotibial band and Achilles tendon lengthening. In 87 patients the operation was carried out during early restrictions of the lower limb joint mobility at an average age of 6.56 years (4.02-8.26, SD 1.42). The follow-up was on average 5.4 years (0.25-9.01, SD 2.7). This group was compared to a control group (natural history) consisting of 100 non-operated DMD patients. A significant (P < 0.001) release of the contractures could be obtained. Loss of walking ability occurred in the control group at an average of 9.29 years (5.85-13.63, SD 1.98) and in the operated group at an average of 10.55 years (8.17-14.39, SD 1.76). This shows that early lower limb surgery leads to a prolongation of independent ambulation of 1.25 years on average. In contrast to the patients of the control group all treated patients between ages 6 and 8 years could walk independently. The positive influence of early lower limb surgery could also be shown by the development of Hammersmith motor ability score, CIDD (Council of Investigation of Duchenne Dystrophy) grading and Vignos scale. Nevertheless, in consideration of the well-known course of DMD not only the prolongation of ambulation but also the achieved prolongation of assisted standing ability with no or mild contractures are aims of lower limb surgery. Since no improvement of muscle strength could be observed after lower limb surgery, further studies have to investigate if additionally administered steroids can prolong ambulation after early lower limb surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Loss of walking ability occurred in the control group at an average of 9.29 years (5.85-13.63, SD 1.98) and in the operated group at an average of 10.55 years (8.17-14.39, SD 1.76).\"]}"}]}

Objective To evaluate the clinical course in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy admitted to our department who received corticosteroid treatment and to compare their course with that in patients who did not receive corticosteroid treatment.Patients and methodsWe performed a retrospective study of 20 pediatric patients with a diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy who were offered corticosteroid treatment: 10 patients received deflazacort and 10 refused the treatment. The MRC muscular strength scale and Vignos' functional scale were used to evaluate clinical course, which was compared in both groups.ResultsUntreated patients showed progressive worsening. Corticosteroid-treated patients showed disease stabilization both in muscular strength and functional performance. In addition, muscular balance improved in 70 % of these patients, but only 2 % showed functional improvement. The positive effect of steroid treatment had a mean duration of 12 months. Loss of independent gait occurred at similar ages in both groups (10.3 vs. 10.5 years). The results of Achilles' tendon surgery were poor.ConclusionsCorticosteroids produced clinical stabilization and improved muscular strength. Functional improvement was not significant, including loss of gait, probably because this loss also depends on an increase in joint contracture. Good coordination among multiprofessional teams is essential to achieve optimal results.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Loss of independent gait occurred at similar ages in both groups (10.3 vs. 10.5 years).\"]}"}]}

To assess the effect of subcutaneous (s.c.) lower limb tenotomies on the ambulatory ability of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), 54 patients were followed. Twenty-nine patients underwent hip, knee, and ankle tenotomies at a mean age of 10 2/12 years and were followed postoperatively for an average of 3 9/12 years. These children continued ambulation in long-leg braces to a mean age of 12 8/12 years and stood to an average of 13 5/12 years. Contracture correction was 49% at the hip, 58% at the knee, and 100% at the ankle. A separate group of 25 children to whom operation was offered but declined, was followed: these children ceased ambulating at a mean age of 10 years and ceased standing at a mean age of 10 2/12 years.

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5.

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds.

These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The development of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) is a major problem in several recombinant protein therapies used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). The etiology of ADAs is multifaceted. The predisposition for a breakdown of immune tolerance is probably genetically determined, and many factors may contribute to the immunogenicity, including structural properties, formation of aggregates, and presence of contaminants and impurities from the industrial manufacturing process. ADAs may have a neutralizing capacity and can reduce or abrogate the bioactivity and therapeutic efficacy of the drug and cause safety issues. Interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 was the first drug approved for the treatment of MS, and-although it is generally recognized that neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) appear and potentially have a negative effect on therapeutic efficacy-the use of routine measurements of NAbs and the interpretation of the presence of NAbs has been debated at length. NAbs appear after 9-18 months of therapy in up to 40% of patients treated with IFN\u03b2, and the frequency and titers of NAbs depend on the IFN\u03b2 preparation. Although all pivotal clinical trials of approved IFN\u03b2 products in MS exhibited a detrimental effect of NAbs after prolonged therapy, some subsequent studies did not observe clinical effects from NAbs, which led to the claim that NAbs did not matter. However, it is now largely agreed that persistently high titers of NAbs indicate an abrogation of the biological response and, hence, an absence of therapeutic efficacy, and this observation should lead to a change of therapy. Low and medium titers are ambiguous, and treatment decisions should be guided by determination of in vivo messenger RNA myxovirus resistance protein A induction after IFN\u03b2 administration and clinical disease activity. During treatment with glatiramer acetate, ADAs occur frequently but do not appear to adversely affect treatment efficacy or result in adverse events. ADAs occur in approximately 5% of patients treated with natalizumab within 6 months of therapy, and persistent NAbs are associated with a lack of efficacy and acute infusion-related reactions and should instigate a change of therapy. When using the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies ocrelizumab and ofatumumab in the treatment of MS, it is not necessary to test for NAbs as these occur very infrequently. Alemtuzumab is immunogenic, but routine measurements of ADAs are not recommended as the antibodies in the pivotal 2-year trials at the population level did not influence lymphocyte depletion or repopulation, efficacy, or safety. However, in some individuals, NAbs led to poor lymphocyte depletion.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"When using the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies ocrelizumab and ofatumumab in the treatment of MS, it is not necessary to test for NAbs as these occur very infrequently. \"]}"}]}

Ocrelizumab is a humanised anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody developed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017 for using in adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Ocrelizumab is the only disease-modifying therapy (DMT) approved for PPMS. In November 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) also approved ocrelizumab as the first drug for people with early PPMS. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the benefits, harms, and tolerability of ocrelizumab in people with MS. To assess the benefits, harms, and tolerability of ocrelizumab in people with RRMS and PPMS. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and two trials registers on 8 October 2021. We screened reference lists, contacted experts, and contacted the main authors of studies. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults diagnosed with RRMS or PPMS according to the McDonald criteria, comparing ocrelizumab alone or associated with other medications, at the approved dose of 600 mg every 24 weeks for any duration, versus placebo or any other active drug therapy. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Four RCTs met our selection criteria. The overall population included 2551 participants; 1370 treated with ocrelizumab 600 mg and 1181 controls. Among the controls, 298 participants received placebo and 883 received interferon beta-1a. The treatment duration was 24 weeks in one study, 96 weeks in two studies, and at least 120 weeks in one study. One study was at high risk of allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel; all four studies were at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. For RRMS, compared with interferon beta-1a, ocrelizumab was associated with: 1. lower relapse rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.73; 2 studies, 1656 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); 2. a lower number of participants with disability progression (hazard ratio (HR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.84; 2 studies, 1656 participants; low-certainty evidence); 3. little to no difference in the number of participants with any adverse event (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04; 2 studies, 1651 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); 4. little to no difference in the number of participants with any serious adverse event (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.11; 2 studies, 1651 participants; low-certainty evidence); 5. a lower number of participants experiencing treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.91; 2 studies, 1651 participants; low-certainty evidence); 6. a lower number of participants with gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.35; 2 studies, 1656 participants; low-certainty evidence); 7. a lower number of participants with new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions on MRI (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.69; 2 studies, 1656 participants; low-certainty evidence) at 96 weeks. For PPMS, compared with placebo, ocrelizumab was associated with: 1. a lower number of participants with disability progression (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98; 1 study, 731 participants; low-certainty evidence); 2. a higher number of participants with any adverse events (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.11; 1 study, 725 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); 3. little to no difference in the number of participants with any serious adverse event (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.23; 1 study, 725 participants; low-certainty evidence); 4. little to no difference in the number of participants experiencing treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.75; 1 study, 725 participants; low-certainty evidence) for at least 120 weeks. There were no data for number of participants with gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions on MRI and number of participants with new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions on MRI. For people with RRMS, ocrelizumab probably results in a large reduction in relapse rate and little to no difference in adverse events when compared with interferon beta-1a at 96 weeks (moderate-certainty evidence). Ocrelizumab may result in a large reduction in disability progression, treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events, number of participants with gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions on MRI, and number of participants with new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions on MRI, and may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events (low-certainty evidence). For people with PPMS, ocrelizumab probably results in a higher rate of adverse events when compared with placebo for at least 120 weeks (moderate-certainty evidence). Ocrelizumab may result in a reduction in disability progression and little to no difference in serious adverse events and treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (low-certainty evidence). Ocrelizumab was well tolerated clinically; the most common adverse events were infusion-related reactions and nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract and upper respiratory tract infections.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis.\", \"BACKGROUND: Ocrelizumab is a humanised anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody developed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Thirteen patients with nonmetastatic gastric adenocarcinoma received endoscopic, peritumoural, submucosal indocyanine green fluorescence (ICG) injections before surgery, and ICG was assessed intraoperatively using a laparoscopic detection system. All patients underwent a laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy, and 10 of them received D2 lymphadenectomies.

The superficial temporal artery (STA) frontal branch flap is susceptible to venous congestion because of its unpredictable and variable outflow. The authors applied indocyanine green angiogra-phy in identifying the superficial temporal vessels to help surgeons with proper flap designs to avoid severe complications. A retrospective review from 2015 to 2020 was conducted. All the patients who underwent indocyanine green angiography before forehead flap transfer for facial defect reconstruction were reviewed. The STA and vein were observed using indocyanine green angiography preoperatively. The relationship between the artery and vein was investigated. The venous anatomy was analyzed to guide the pedicle design. The survival of the flap and complications were assessed. A total of 12 patients were identified and included in this study. Indocyanine green angiography allows clear visualization of the detailed anatomy of the STA and vein. The frontal branch of the vein had great variations and generally diverged from the arterial branch. The tiny venae comitantes provided sufficient drainage for 2 small forehead flaps. The frontal branch of the vein entered the forehead and was used as the outflow channel in 4 patients. The parietal branch of the vein, which consistently gave off secondary tributaries to the superior forehead, was included in the pedicle in 6 patients. All flaps survived without complications. indocyanine green angiography provided accurate localization of the superficial temporal vessels.

To compare the results of macular hole surgery with the use of indocyanine green (ICG) to assist internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling and macular hole surgery without indocyanine green use. A retrospective, comparative, consecutive study of 68 patients with macular holes. In total, 34 patients underwent vitrectomy and ILM peeling, and 34 patients underwent vitrectomy and ILM peeling with the assistance of indocyanine green. The main outcome measures were postoperative visual acuity and macular hole status. Indocyanine green increased the ability to visualise and peel the ILM. The average preoperative visual acuity in the group where ICG was used was 6/36 and the group where ICG was not used was 6/60. The average follow-up was 25 weeks for the ICG group and 53 weeks for the group with no ICG. Both groups were also compared at 25 weeks follow-up. Hole closure rate for the group with ICG was 97% compared to 91% without ICG. The mean postoperative visual acuity was 6/24 for the group with ICG and 6/12 for the group without ICG, a difference of two lines on the Snellen chart when compared with the preoperative acuity (P-value 0.299, Student's t-test). Both groups had a mean improvement of Snellen acuity of two lines (ICG group: P-value 0.0002, Student's t-test; no ICG group: P-value 0.00004, Student's t-test). In all, 83% of patients in the ICG group maintained or improved their visual acuity compared to 91% in the group without ICG. There is no doubt that indocyanine green stains and assists in visualisation and therefore increases the ease of peeling the ILM in macular hole surgery. Initially, there was concern regarding a poorer outcome for patients with the use of ICG, which has also been previously discussed in the literature. When the two groups were compared at a similar follow-up time of approximately 25 weeks, it was shown that there was no statistically significant difference between the outcomes in the two groups. This study had an improved hole closure rate for the group where ICG was used, although it was not statistically significant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"PURPOSE: To compare the results of macular hole surgery with the use of indocyanine green (ICG) to assist internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling and macular hole surgery without indocyanine green use.METHODS: A retrospective, comparative, consecutive study of 68 patients w\"]}"}]}

Indocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent dye largely used as functional indicator, fluorescent imaging contrast agent and recently as enhancer during diode laser photocoagulation. In this study, indocyanine green was incorporated in an emulsion to increase its residence time in blood. In vitro results to show that indocyanine green absorption peak is shifted towards longer wavelength (from 778\u2009nm to 794\u2009nm) close to the peak emission wavelength of the near infrared diode laser (805\u2009nm) used during laser-induced photocoagulation. Plasmatic clearance is slower (in the 15-60\u2009min time interval) compared to the plasmatic clearance of ICG administered as an aqueous solution. The absorbing capacity of ICG at 805\u2009nm shows a two- to threefold increase when indocyanine green is incorporated in this emulsion. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Indocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent dye largely used as functional indicator, fluorescent imaging contrast agent and recently as enhancer during diode laser photocoagulation.\"]}"}]}

Indocyanine green (ICG) is extremely effective when used as a vital stain during macular hole surgery. By staining the internal limiting membrane, ICG facilitates removal of this delicate and sometimes hard to visualize structure. There is, however, considerable debate regarding its safety. This review considers the clinical and experimental studies of ICG and a related agent, infracyanine green. Some clinical papers show visual field defects, reduced visual acuity, and persistence of ICG at the macula and optic nerve. Other clinical studies fail to demonstrate toxicity. The experimental studies are also conflicting, but there are emerging trends. These suggest that surgeons who continue to use ICG should use concentrations not greater than 0.05 mg/ml, in fluid-filled eyes, with short exposure times, iso-osmolar solutions, and avoid proximal or prolonged endoillumination of stained tissue. A smaller number of studies suggest that infracyanine green produces similar staining to ICG, and may possibly be safer, but there are too few well-designed studies to reach a conclusion. Although the use of ICG continues, on the balance of evidence, this review suggests that it is has the potential to produce subtle visual damage.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Indocyanine green (ICG) is extremely effective when used as a vital stain during macular hole surgery.\"]}"}]}

Indocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent dye that has been used for the imaging of retinal and choroidal vasculatures for more than 30 years. Its high molecular weight, specific metabolic features, and its infrared spectra make the specificity of the images obtained with this dye in ophthalmology. The focus of this paper is to review the basic properties of ICG and to show how some clinical features related to basic properties also depend on the instrumentation used to perform ICG angiography. Indocyanine green has a complex molecular structure that leads to amphiphilic properties, that is, both hydrophilic and lipophilic properties. These properties explain that a specific interaction with phospholipids influences the emission spectrum and the fluorescence yield of ICG. The composition of cell membranes mainly composed of phospholipid bilayers is consistent with a binding and/or a diffusion of ICG molecules observed on angiograms. Likewise, ICG can bind to the lipid component of miliary drusen, explaining their hyperfluorescence. A knowledge of ICG basic properties and interactions may allow a better understanding of angiograms performed with this dye.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Indocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent dye that has been used for the imaging of retinal and choroidal vasculatures for more than 30 years.\"]}"}]}

Indocyanine green (ICG) is a sterile, water-soluble, tricarbocyanine dye that can be used in fundus angiography as an adjunct to sodium fluorescein. It has a peak spectral absorption of 805 nm in blood plasma or blood, as compared with fluorescein, which has a peak spectral absorption of 465 nm. Because the absorption and emission of ICG lies around 835 nm, transmission of energy by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and serosanguinated material is more efficient in this region than in the region of visible light energy. ICG has the property of being approximately 98% bound to blood protein, disallowing extravasation of excessive dye in the highly fenestrated choroidal vasculature. The characteristics of ICG are discussed, including administration and dosage, adverse reactions and use of infrared filters for fundus photography. In addition, two cases are presented to illustrate the clinical application of ICG for diagnosis and treatment of choroidal neovascular membranes. ICG videoangiography can be used to reveal subfoveal choroidal neovascular membranes not previously identified with fluorescein; angiograms can also be used to dramatically highlight retinal and choroidal changes.

Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) is an invaluable animal model for studying inflammatory eye disease in humans. Indocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent dye that can be used to image both retinal and choroidal vessels. This study was performed to examined the retinal and choroidal vascular abnormalities of a rat model of EAU using ICG and fluorescein as the contrast media to assess the suitability of this model for studying ICG angiographic abnormalities in inflammatory eye disease in humans. Twenty-six black-hooded Lister rats were inoculated with bovine retinal S-antigen plus adjuvant with or without Bordetella pertussis antigen. Fluorescein and ICG angiograms were performed at different stages of clinical disease with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope. EAU was more severe and primarily choroidal disease in rats given Bordetella pertussis, but no animals showed evidence of dye leakage from large choroidal vessels. There was frank leakage of indocyanine green from retinal vessels. Leakage of both fluorescein and ICG retinal vessels largely correlated with disease activity. Retinal pigment epithelial lesions either corresponded to areas of hypofluorescence on the ICG angiogram alone or were represented by areas of ICG hyperfluorescence that had overlying areas of fluorescein leakage from retinal capillaries. This study has demonstrated the vascular abnormalities of this model of EAU using ICG and fluorescein as the contrast media. The suitability of this method for studying ICG angiographic abnormalities in inflammatory eye disease in humans is encouraging.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Indocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent dye that can be used to image both retinal and choroidal vessels\"]}"}]}

Recently, intraoperative fluorescence angiography in which indocyanine green (ICG) is used as a tracer has been introduced as a novel technique to confirm successful aneurysm clipping. The aim of the present study was to assess whether ICG videoangiography is also suitable for intraoperative confirmation of extracranial-intracranial bypass patency. Forty patients undergoing cerebral revascularization for hemodynamic cerebral ischemia (11 patients), moya-moya disease (18 patients), or complex intracranial aneurysms (11 patients) were included. Superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass surgery was performed 35 times in 30 patients (five patients with moyamoya underwent bilateral procedures), STA-posterior cerebral artery bypass surgery in two patients, and saphenous vein (SV) high-flow bypass surgery in eight patients. In each patient, following the completion of the anastomosis, ICG (0.3 mg/kg body weight) was given systemically via an intravenous bolus injection. A near-infrared light emitted by laser diodes was used to illuminate the operating field and the intravascular fluorescence was recorded using an optical filter-equipped video camera. The findings of ICG videoangiography were compared with those of postoperative digital subtraction (DS) or computerized tomography (CT) angiography. In all cases excellent visualization of cerebral arteries, the bypass graft, and brain perfusion was noted. Indocyanine green videoangiography was used to identify four nonfunctioning STA-MCA bypasses, which could be revised successfully in all cases. In two cases of SV high-flow bypasses, ICG videoangiography revealed stenosis at the proximal anastomotic site, which was also revised successfully. In all cases the final findings of ICG videoangiography could be positively validated during the postoperative course by performing DS or CT angiography. Indocyanine green videoangiography provides a reliable and rapid intraoperative assessment of bypass patency. Thus, ICG videoangiography may help reduce the incidence of early bypass graft failure.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"OBJECT: Recently, intraoperative fluorescence angiography in which indocyanine green (ICG) is used as a tracer has been introduced as a novel technique to confirm successful aneurysm clipping\"]}"}]}

Indocyanine green was injected into the vitreous cavity according to previously published protocol. The ILM was removed with a bent-tipped microvitreoretinal blade and ILM forceps. Photocoagulation was performed with an 810-nm infrared diode endolaser. Photocoagulation of the retina stained with ICG in areas with intact ILM produced more intense and superficial appearing retinal burns than photocoagulation where the ILM had been peeled. The retinal burns in areas of intact ILM stained with ICG also appeared more superficial than those typical of this laser when ICG is not used.

Indocyanine green (ICG) is one of the methods used to assess vascularization, but this assessment is usually subjective. Our group designed the SERGREEN program to obtain an objective measurement of the degree of vascularization. We do not know how long after ICG administration the fluorescence of the tissues should be evaluated, or how far away the measurement should be performed. The aim of this study is to establish the optimal moment and distance for analyzing the fluorescence saturation of ICG. Prospective observational study in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The optimal time for ICG analysis was tested in a sample of 20 patients (10 right colon and 10 left colon), and the optimal distance in a sample of ten patients. ICG was administered intravenously, and colon vascularization was quantified using SERGREEN; RGB (Red, Green, Blue) encoding was used. The intensity curve of the ICG was analyzed for ten minutes after its administration. Distances of 1, 3, and 5\u00a0cm were tested. The intensity of fluorescence increased until 1.5\u00a0min after ICG administration (reaching figures of 112.49 in the right colon and 93.95 in the left). It then remained fairly stable until 3.5\u00a0min (98.49 in the right and 83.35 in the left), at which point it began to decrease gradually. ICG saturation was inversely proportional to the distance between the camera and the tissue. The best distance was 5\u00a0cm, where the confidence interval was narrower [CI 86.66-87.53]. The optimal time for determining ICG in the colon is between 1.5 and 3.5\u00a0min, in both right and left colon. The optimal distance is 5\u00a0cm. This information will help to establish parameters of comparison in normal and pathological situations.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Indocyanine green (ICG) is one of the methods used to assess vascularization, but this assessment is usually subjective\"]}"}]}

Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging is widely used in abdominal surgery. The implementation of minimally invasive rectal surgery using new methods like robotics or a transanal approach required improvement of optical systems. In that setting, ICG fluorescence optimizes intraoperative vision of anatomical structures by improving blood and lymphatic flow. The purpose of this review was to summarize all potential applications of this upcoming technology in rectal cancer surgery. Each type of use has been separately addressed and the evidence was investigated. During rectal resection, ICG fluorescence angiography is mainly used to evaluate the perfusion of the colonic stump in order to reduce the risk of anastomotic leaks. In addition, ICG fluorescence imaging allows easy visualization of organs such as the ureter or urethra to protect them from injury. This intraoperative technology is a valuable tool for conducting lymph node dissection along the iliac lymphatic chain or to better identifying the rectal dissection planes when a transanal approach is performed. This is an overview of the applications of ICG fluorescence imaging in current surgical practice and a synthesis of the results obtained from the literature. Although further studies are need to investigate the real clinical benefits, these findings may enhance use of ICG fluorescence in current clinical practice and stimulate future research on new applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Intraoperative use of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging in rectal cancer surgery: The state of the art.\", \"Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging is widely used in abdominal surgery.

Recently, indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging has been used for the identification of the parathyroid glands (PG) during thyroid and parathyroid surgery. However, an overall consensus on the optimal technique, the dosage, the timing of the ICG administration and finally its interpretation and clinical usefulness is still lacking evidence. The aim of this review is to investigate the use of ICG angiography during thyroidectomy and/or parathyroidectomy for identification as well as for the perfusion integrity of the parathyroid glands. The PubMed database was systematically searched for publications regarding intraoperative ICG imaging in patients that undergo thyroidectomy or parathyroidectomy. Eighteen publications reporting on 612 patients, namely 71 parathyroidectomy and 541 thyroidectomy patients met the inclusion criteria. Eleven publications reported the use of ICG angiography for the identification of the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy and seven during parathyroidectomy for primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism. ICG fluorescence imaging is a simple, fast and reproducible method capable of intraoperatively visualizing and assessing the function of parathyroid glands, and can, therefore, assist surgeons in their decision-making.

The present review aims to analyze the current data available on the different applications of indocyanine green (ICG) in gynecology. A semantic review of English-language publications was performed by searching for MeSH terms and keywords in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The studies were finally selected by one author according to the aim of this review. ICG is a highly water-soluble tricarbocyanine dye that fluoresces in the NIR spectrum. Approved by the FDA in 1959, it can be administered either IV (usual dose of 5 mg) or locally/submucosally (usual dose of 5-6.25 mg) according to the pathology or indication. It is used most often in the setting of oncology, endometriosis and other gynecological conditions. In oncological applications, ICG is used to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) using near-infrared light in endometrial, cervical and vulvar cancers. The main advantages that it offers include a reduction of surgical time, improved SLN detection rates, and the ability to avoid radioactivity. In cases of endometrial (submucosal or hysteroscopic applications) or cervical (intracervical administration) cancer, ICG can detect SLN at an accuracy of 95% to 98%. For vulvar cancer, the SLN detection rate can reach 100%. In endometriosis, the lack of good evidence hinders the final evaluation of this method in both diagnostic and therapeutic scenarios. An analytical, well-designed, prospective study is currently underway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The present review aims to analyze the current data available on the different applications of indocyanine green (ICG) in gynecology.

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

The chaperonin GroEL is a megadalton-sized molecular machine that plays an essential role in the bacterial cell assisting protein folding to the native state through actions requiring ATP binding and hydrolysis. A combination of medicinal chemistry and genetics has been employed to generate an orthogonal pair, a small molecule that selectively inhibits ATPase activity of a GroEL ATP-binding pocket variant. An initial screen of kinase-directed inhibitors identified an active pyrazolo-pyrimidine scaffold that was iteratively modified and screened against a collective of GroEL nucleotide pocket variants to identify a cyclopentyl carboxamide derivative, EC3016, that specifically inhibits ATPase activity and protein folding by the GroEL mutant, I493C, involving a side chain positioned near the base of ATP. This orthogonal pair will enable in vitro studies of the action of ATP in triggering activation of GroEL-mediated protein folding and might enable further studies of GroEL action in vivo. The approach originated for studying kinases by Shokat and his colleagues may thus also be used to study large macromolecular machines.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

While on foraging excursions, fiddler crabs track their burrow location despite having no visual contact with it . They do this by path integration, a common navigational process in which motion vectors (the direction and distance of animals' movements) are summed to form a single \"home vector\" linking the current location with the point of origin. Here, we identify the mechanism by which the integrator measures distance, by decoupling motor output from both inertial and visual feedback. Fiddler crabs were passively translated to a position such that the home vector lay across an acetate sheet on the ground. After being frightened, crabs tried to escape but slipped as they did so. Detailed high-speed video analysis reveals that crabs measure distance by integrating strides, rather than linear acceleration or optic flow: the number of steps they took depended on both the length of the home vector and how large their steps were, whether they slipped and fell short or not. This is the most direct evidence to date of a stride integrator that is flexible enough to account for significant variation in stride length and frequency.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Probing microarray assays in the presence of a hybridization mix retrieves precious information on hybridization kinetics. However, in common detection schemes, useful surface signals compete with the high supernatant background from labelled targets in the mix. A known solution consists in exciting specifically the microarray surface with evanescent fields. Configurations using planar optical waveguides to produce such fields are shown here to present also a dramatic excitation irradiance enhancement at the guide/surrounding matter interface. We compare theoretically and experimentally a guided excitation with a classical external excitation. A full electromagnetic analysis predicts an irradiance increase higher than 10(4) for adequately tailored waveguides. We deposited high-index TiO(2) sol-gel waveguides on glass substrates according to best simulations. Quantitative enhancement analysis exploiting actual biological fluorescent spots perfectly confirms the irradiance amplification effect of a thin waveguide. The impact of amplification on the design of biochip readers is discussed since it leaves ample margin for simple and low-cost light couplers, advantageous in affordable readers and sensor systems.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits.

Our aim was to describe the natural history of XLA. A nationwide multicenter study based on the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry was established in 2000 in Italy. Affected patients were enrolled by documenting centers, and the patients' laboratory, clinical, and imaging data were recorded on an annual base. Data on the patients (N\u00a0= 168) were derived from a cumulative follow-up of 1370 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 8.35 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis decreased after establishment of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry (84 months before vs 23 months after). Respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent clinical symptoms at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Regular immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduced the incidence of invasive infections. Affected patients developed chronic lung disease over time (47% after 40 years of follow-up) in the presence of chronic sinusitis (84%). Malignancies were documented in a minority of cases (3.7%). Overall survival for affected patients was significantly reduced when compared with that for the healthy male Italian population, and it further deteriorated in the presence of chronic lung disease. This is the first detailed long-term follow-up study for patients with XLA, revealing that although immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduces the incidence of invasive infections, it does not appear to influence the development of chronic lung disease. The overall survival of affected patients is reduced. Further studies are warranted to improve patients' clinical management and increase awareness among physicians.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) reduce febrile neutropaenia (FN) incidence but may be used inconsistently in current practice (CP). This study compared the efficacy of pegfilgrastim primary prophylaxis (PPP) with CP neutropaenia management in breast cancer. Individual patient data (N=2282) from 11 clinical trials and observational studies using chemotherapy regimens with > or =15% FN risk and PPP (6 mg, all cycles) or CP (no G-CSF or any cycle G-CSF/pegfilgrastim) were included in an integrated analysis. Most patients received docetaxel-containing regimens. A generalised linear mixed model was fitted (N=2210). Neutropaenia prophylaxis (PPP versus CP), age and disease stage influenced the incidence of FN. Overall, FN was less frequent with PPP than with CP (odds ratio [OR]: 0.124; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08, 0.194; P<0.0001). Odds for cycle 1 FN, dose reductions > or =15% and FN-related hospitalisation were also significantly lower with PPP. These data support PPP in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with moderately high/high FN risk.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Cytochrome P450 1A1 is a major enzyme in the bioactivation of exogenous procarcinogens of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the contribution of common genetic variants in CYP1A1 to the HCC risk in Chinese populations has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we examined the association between HCC and four selected tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP1A1, and the risk of CYP1A1 haplotypes/diplotypes in 1006 pathologically confirmed HCC patients and 1015 cancer-free controls, from a Han Chinese population. Haplotypes/diplotypes were constructed from observed genotypes using the Haplo.Stats program. Relative risk was estimated by using multivariable logistic regression method. To summarise, we detected an increased HCC risk in rs4646421 variant carriers (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.61) and rs2198843 variant carriers (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.69), and a reduced risk of HCC (OR 0.70. 95% CI 0.52-0.94) associated with homozygote carriers of rs4886605 variant. These association signals were also observed in non-smokers with rs4646421 (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.16-2.08) and rs4886605 (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.91). Compared to the most common CYP1A1 haplotype CCAG, the haplotype TTGC conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.52). Similarly, the TTGC/TTGC diplotype conferred an increased risk of HCC compared with diplotype CCAG/CCAG (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.23-3.45, P=0.006). Interestingly, the diplotype TTAC/CCAG also conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.22-2.54, P=0.003). Our results suggested that common genetic variants in CYP1A1 may modulate the risk of developing HCC in the study population, particularly in non-smokers. However, our findings need to be validated in at least one independent study of Han Chinese population.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is the latest and perhaps most significant innovation in surgery since Phillipe Mouret of France performed the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1987. This new \"minimum-invasive\" concept that promises scar-free surgery is steadily gathering momentum. It is another milestone in our quest to eliminate surgical trauma, speed patient recovery time and decrease surgical wound-related complications. On 22 July 2005, the Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research (NOSCAR) published a white paper highlighting the barriers to NOTES development, which included the need for appropriate selection of access points, effective closure of the enterotomy site, innovative tools, stable platforms and improved endoscopic orientation. These are just some of the many issues that need to be resolved before the NOTES concept and technique could become a common feature of modern surgery. The publication of the white paper ushered in the beginning of multiple research projects using animal models to test the application of NOTES and its newly developed instruments. The success in animal models was followed by several highly selected successful human trials. National and international surgical innovation departments should now be created where medical industry personnel including inventors, designers and engineers can work together with the medical and surgical providers to address all the limitations affecting NOTES progress.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

A novel automated chemiluminescence (CL) read-out system for analytical flow-through microarrays based on multiplexed immunoassays has been developed. The microarray chip reader (MCR 3) is designed as a stand-alone platform, with the goal to quantify multiple analytes in complex matrices of food and liquid samples for field analysis or for routine analytical laboratories. The CL microarray platform is a self-contained system for the fully automated multiplexed immunoanalysis: the microarray chip, the fluidic system and the software module enable automated calibration and determination of analyte concentrations during a whole working day. The detection of antibiotics in milk was demonstrated to validate this device. There are few quantitative multi-residue detection methods for routine analysis although the EU has defined maximum residue limits (MRLs) for a number of antibacterial reagents. Therefore, an automated multianalyte detection instrument is needed quantifying simultaneously antibiotics within some minutes. Also regeneration is required to avoid replacing the assay surface. The MCR 3 uses a microarray chip, which consists of two channels for parallel measurement and regeneration. The microarray chip is designed for parallel analysis of up to 13 different antibiotics in milk applying an indirect competitive microarray immunoassay (MIA). Microspotted antibiotics are directly coupled to epoxylated PEG surfaces. As an initial example, penicillin G is quantified in milk on the MCR 3. The penicillin G surface is regenerable for 47 measurement cycles per channel. A limit of detection (LOD) of 1.1 microg/L is achieved by an assay time of 6 min.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

The efficacy of breast-conserving surgery for the local control of early breast cancer has been repeatedly evidenced. Although immediate reconstruction following breast-conserving surgery has been described, little information is available regarding surgical management in reoperative settings due to positive margins. We studied the influence of intraoperatively assessed and postoperatively controlled surgical margin status on the type of breast-conserving surgery and report our results regarding complications in a reoperative breast reconstruction scenario. All patients were seen by a multidisciplinary team who recommended breast-conserving surgery. According to the breast volume, ptosis and tumor size/location, the patients were also evaluated by a plastic surgeon, who recommended reconstruction with the appropriate technique. Intraoperative assessment of surgical margins was determined by histological examination of frozen sections. The mean follow-up time was 48 months. Two hundred and eighteen patients (88.5%) underwent breast-conserving surgery and immediate reconstruction. Twelve (5.5%) patients had a positive tumor margin after review of the permanent section. All patients underwent re-exploration. In 1.3%, a second reconstructive technique was indicated and in 2.2% a skin-sparing mastectomy with total reconstruction was performed. Our findings support the important role of the intraoperative assessment of surgical margins and its interference in the selection of reconstruction techniques and negative margins; however, it will not guarantee complete excision of the tumor. Success depends on coordinated planning with the oncologic surgeon and careful intraoperative management.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The thymus is critical for central tolerance and diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire development, to provide lifelong defense against pathogens while maintaining self-tolerance. Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Alternative splicing (AS) generates multiple transcripts from the same gene, however, AS contribution to proteome complexity remains elusive in plants. AS is prevalent under stress conditions in plants, but it is counterintuitive why plants would invest in protein synthesis under declining energy supply. We propose that plants employ AS not only to potentially increasing proteomic complexity, but also to buffer against the stress-responsive transcriptome to reduce the metabolic cost of translating all AS transcripts. To maximise efficiency under stress, plants may make fewer proteins with disordered domains via AS to diversify substrate specificity and maintain sufficient regulatory capacity. Furthermore, we suggest that chromatin state-dependent AS engenders short/long-term stress memory to mediate reproducible transcriptional response in the future.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Alternative splicing (AS) generates multiple transcripts from the same gene, however, AS contribution to proteome complexity remains elusive in plants.\", \"We propose that plants employ AS not only to potentially increasing proteomic complexity, but also to buffer against the stress-responsive transcriptome to reduce the metabolic cost of translating all AS transcripts.\"]}"}]}

In agreement, plant mutants defective in splicing factors are severely impaired in their response to abiotic stress.

Alternative splicing, which generates multiple transcripts from the same gene and potentially different protein isoforms, is a key posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism for expanding proteomic diversity and functional complexity in higher eukaryotes. The most recent estimates, based on whole transcriptome sequencing, indicate that about 95 % of human and 60 % of Arabidopsis multi-exon genes undergo alternative splicing, suggesting important roles for this mechanism in biological processes. However, while the misregulation of alternative splicing has been associated with many human diseases, its biological relevance in plant systems is just beginning to unfold. We review here the few plant genes for which the production of multiple splice isoforms has been reported to have a clear in vivo functional impact. These case studies implicate alternative splicing in the control of a wide range of physiological and developmental processes, including photosynthetic and starch metabolism, hormone signaling, seed germination, root growth and flowering, as well as in biotic and abiotic stress responses. Future functional characterization of alternative splicing events and identification of the transcripts targeted by major regulators of this versatile means of modulating gene expression should uncover the breadth of its physiological significance in higher plants.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Alternative splicing, which generates multiple transcripts from the same gene and potentially different protein isoforms, is a key posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism for expanding proteomic diversity and functional complexity in higher eukaryotes.\"]}"}]}

Alternative splicing (AS), in higher eukaryotes, is one of the mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation that generate multiple transcripts from the same gene. One particular mode of AS is the skipping event where an exon may be alternatively excluded or constitutively included in the resulting mature mRNA. Both transcript isoforms from this skipping event site, i.e. in which the exon is either included (inclusion isoform) or excluded (skipping isoform), are typically present in one cell, and maintain a subtle balance that is vital to cellular function and dynamics. However, how the prevailing conditions dictate which isoform is expressed and what biological factors might influence the regulation of this process remain areas requiring further exploration. In this study, we have developed a novel computational method, graph-based exon-skipping scanner (GESS), for de novo detection of skipping event sites from raw RNA-seq reads without prior knowledge of gene annotations, as well as for determining the dominant isoform generated from such sites. We have applied our method to publicly available RNA-seq data in GM12878 and K562 cells from the ENCODE consortium and experimentally validated several skipping site predictions by RT-PCR. Furthermore, we integrated other sequencing-based genomic data to investigate the impact of splicing activities, transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic histone modifications on splicing outcomes. Our computational analysis found that splice sites within the skipping-isoform-dominated group (SIDG) tended to exhibit weaker MaxEntScan-calculated splice site strength around middle, 'skipping', exons compared to those in the inclusion-isoform-dominated group (IIDG). We further showed the positional preference pattern of splicing factors, characterized by enrichment in the intronic splice sites immediately bordering middle exons. Finally, our analysis suggested that different epigenetic factors may introduce a variable obstacle in the process of exon-intron boundary establishment leading to skipping events. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Alternative splicing (AS), in higher eukaryotes, is one of the mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation that generate multiple transcripts from the same gene.\"]}"}]}

Over the past decade, alternative splicing has been progressively recognized as a major mechanism regulating gene expression patterns in different tissues and disease states through the generation of multiple mRNAs from the same gene transcript. This process requires the joining of selected exons or usage of different pairs of splice sites and is regulated by gene-specific combinations of RNA-binding proteins. One archetypical splicing regulator is SRSF1, for which we review the molecular mechanisms and posttranscriptional modifications involved in its life cycle. These include alternative splicing of SRSF1 itself, regulatory protein phosphorylation events, and the role of nuclear versus cytoplasmic SRSF1 localization. In addition, we resume current knowledge on deregulated SRSF1 expression in tumors and describe SRSF1-regulated alternative transcripts with functional consequences for cancer cell biology at different stages of tumor development. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Over the past decade, alternative splicing has been progressively recognized as a major mechanism regulating gene expression patterns in different tissues and disease states through the generation of multiple mRNAs from the same gene transcript.\"]}"}]}

The process of excising introns from pre-mRNA complexes is directed by specific genomic DNA sequences at intron-exon borders known as splice sites. These regions contain well-conserved motifs which allow the splicing process to proceed in a regulated and structured manner. However, as well as conventional splicing, several genes have the inherent capacity to undergo alternative splicing, thus allowing synthesis of multiple gene transcripts, perhaps with different functional properties. Within the human genome, therefore, through alternative splicing, it is possible to generate over 100,000 physiological gene products from the 35,000 or so known genes. Abnormalities in normal or alternative splicing, however, account for about 15% of all inherited single gene disorders, including many with a skin phenotype. These splicing abnormalities may arise through inherited mutations in constitutive splice sites or other critical intronic or exonic regions. This review article examines the process of normal intron-exon splicing, as well as what is known about alternative splicing of human genes. The review then addresses pathological disruption of normal intron-exon splicing that leads to inherited skin diseases, either resulting from mutations in sequences that have a direct influence on splicing or that generate cryptic splice sites. Examples of aberrant splicing, especially for the COL7A1 gene in patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, are discussed and illustrated. The review also examines a number of recently introduced computational tools that can be used to predict whether genomic DNA sequences changes may affect splice site selection and how robust the influence of such mutations might be on splicing.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"However, as well as conventional splicing, several genes have the inherent capacity to undergo alternative splicing, thus allowing synthesis of multiple gene transcripts, perhaps with different functional properties.\"]}"}]}

Alternative splicing (AS) increases the proteomic and functional capacity of genomes through the generation of alternative mRNA transcripts from the same gene. AS is now estimated to occur in a third of Arabidopsis and rice genes, and includes genes involved in the control of growth and development, responses to stress and signalling. Regulation of AS reflects the interactions between positive and negative cis sequences in the precursor messenger RNA and a range of trans-acting factors. The levels and activities of these factors differ in different cells and growth conditions. To identify changes in AS in multiple genes simultaneously, we have established a reproducible RT-PCR panel that can analyse 96 alternative splicing events and accurately measure the ratio of alternatively spliced products. This procedure detected statistically significant changes in AS in different plant organs, in plants grown under different light and day-length conditions, and in plants overexpressing splicing factors. The system provides a convenient, medium-throughput means of monitoring changes in AS in multiple genes. It can readily be applied to much larger or targeted sets of gene transcripts to generate information on the significance and regulation of AS in plant growth and development, specific processes and responses to external stimuli.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Alternative splicing (AS) increases the proteomic and functional capacity of genomes through the generation of alternative mRNA transcripts from the same gene.\"]}"}]}

Alternative splicing is an important biological process in the generation of multiple functional transcripts from the same genomic sequences. Differential analysis of splice junctions (SJs) and intron retentions (IRs) is helpful in the detection of alternative splicing events. In this study, we conducted differential analysis of SJs and IRs by use of DEXSeq, a Bioconductor package originally designed for differential exon usage analysis in RNA-seq data analysis. We set up an analysis pipeline including mapping of RNA-seq reads, the preparation of count tables of SJs and IRs as the input files, and the differential analysis in DEXSeq. We analyzed the public RNA-seq datasets generated from RNAi experiments on Drosophila melanogaster S2-DRSC cells to deplete RNA-binding proteins (GSE18508). The analysis confirmed previous findings on the alternative splicing of the trol and Ant2 (sesB) genes in the CG8144 (ps)-depletion experiment and identified some new alternative splicing events in other RNAi experiments. We also identified IRs that were confirmed in our SJ analysis. The proposed method used in our study can output the genomic coordinates of differentially used SJs and thus enable sequence motif search. Sequence motif search and gene function annotation analysis helped us infer the underlying mechanism in alternative splicing events. To further evaluate this method, we also applied the method to public RNA-seq data from human breast cancer (GSE45419) and the plant Arabidopsis (SRP008262). In conclusion, our study showed that DEXSeq can be adapted to differential analysis of SJs and IRs, which will facilitate the identification of alternative splicing events and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of transcription processes and disease development. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Alternative splicing is an important biological process in the generation of multiple functional transcripts from the same genomic sequences.\"]}"}]}

Alternative splicing generates multiple transcript and protein isoforms from a single gene and controls transcript intracellular localization and stability by coupling to mRNA export and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). RNA interference (RNAi) is a potent mechanism to modulate gene expression. However, its interactions with alternative splicing are poorly understood. We used artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs, also termed shRNAmiR) to knockdown all splice variants of selected target genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that splice variants, which vary by their protein-coding capacity, subcellular localization and sensitivity to NMD, are affected differentially by an amiRNA, although all of them contain the target site. Particular transcript isoforms escape amiRNA-mediated degradation due to their nuclear localization. The nuclear and NMD-sensitive isoforms mask RNAi action in alternatively spliced genes. Interestingly, Arabidopsis SPL genes, which undergo alternative splicing and are targets of miR156, are regulated in the same manner. Moreover, similar results were obtained in mammalian cells using siRNAs, indicating cross-kingdom conservation of these interactions among RNAi and splicing isoforms. Furthermore, we report that amiRNA can trigger artificial alternative splicing, thus expanding the RNAi functional repertoire. Our findings unveil novel interactions between different post-transcriptional processes in defining transcript fates and regulating gene expression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Alternative splicing generates multiple transcript and protein isoforms from a single gene and controls transcript intracellular localization and stability by coupling to mRNA export and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD).\"]}"}]}

Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is one of the main mechanisms regulating gene expression that generates multiple transcripts from one gene. The review considers the specific role that intramolecular secondary structures arising through the interaction of distant complementary regions of introns play in regulating alternative splicing. Examples where aberrant splicing associated with hereditary disorders is corrected by altering the pre-mRNA secondary structures are described. The advances and prospects in whole transcriptome analysis of structured RNA regions and studies of their role in regulating alternative splicing are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is one of the main mechanisms regulating gene expression that generates multiple transcripts from one gene.\"]}"}]}

Alternative splicing generates multiple transcript and protein isoforms from the same gene and thus is important in gene expression regulation. To date, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is the standard method for quantifying changes in alternative splicing on a genome-wide scale. Understanding the current limitations of RNA-seq is crucial for reliable analysis and the lack of high quality, comprehensive transcriptomes for most species, including model organisms such as Arabidopsis, is a major constraint in accurate quantification of transcript isoforms. To address this, we designed a novel pipeline with stringent filters and assembled a comprehensive Reference Transcript Dataset for Arabidopsis (AtRTD2) containing 82,190 non-redundant transcripts from 34 212 genes. Extensive experimental validation showed that AtRTD2 and its modified version, AtRTD2-QUASI, for use in Quantification of Alternatively Spliced Isoforms, outperform other available transcriptomes in RNA-seq analysis. This strategy can be implemented in other species to build a pipeline for transcript-level expression and alternative splicing analyses.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Alternative splicing generates multiple transcript and protein isoforms from the same gene and thus is important in gene expression regulation.\"]}"}]}

Alternative splicing is a widespread phenomenon, which generates multiple isoforms of the gene product. Reproductive development is the key process for crop production. Although numerous forms of alternative splicing have been identified in model plants, large-scale study of alternative splicing dynamics during reproductive development in rice has not been conducted. Here, we investigated alternative splicing of reproductive development of young panicles (YP), unfertilized florets (UF) and fertilized florets (F) in rice using direct RNA sequencing, small RNA sequencing, and degradome sequencing. We identified a total of 35,317 alternative splicing (AS) events, among which 67.2% splicing events were identified as novel alternative splicing events. Intron retention (IR) was the most abundant alternative splicing subtype. Splicing factors that differentially expressed and alternatively spliced could result in global alternative splicing. Global analysis of miRNAs-targets prediction revealed that alternative spliced transcripts affected miRNAs' targets during development. Degradome sequencing detected only 6.8% of the differentially alternative splicing transcripts, suggesting a productive transcripts generation during development. In addition, alternative splicing isoforms of Co-like, a transcription factor, interacted with Casein kinase 1-like protein HD1 (CKI) examined in luciferase assay, which could modulate normal male-floral organs development and flowering time. These results reveal that alternative splicing is intensely associated with developmental stages, and a high complexity of gene regulation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Alternative splicing is a widespread phenomenon, which generates multiple isoforms of the gene product.\"]}"}]}

Alternative splicing of messenger RNA (mRNA) precursors generates multiple transcripts from a single primary transcript. Identification and verification of splice variants and cloning of the corresponding isoforms is crucial for analyzing gene expression and understanding the related functions. For a specific gene, the abundance of the transcripts produced can vary significantly and is subject to various regulations. It can be difficult to detect low-level splicing variants when others are present in high abundance. Here we describe a method for the amplification of low-abundance mRNA splicing variants for such situations. This method introduces a hydrolysis step prior to the conventional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). After the transcripts are reverse-transcripted into complementary DNA (cDNA), the cDNA of high-abundance transcript is suppressed from amplification by cleavage at the chosen exon to enhance the amplification of the low-abundance transcripts that do not have the targeted exon and are normally undetectable. We provide two examples to illustrate the detection of low-abundance splicing variants from two genes.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Alternative splicing of messenger RNA (mRNA) precursors generates multiple transcripts from a single primary transcript.\"]}"}]}

Among eukaryotic organisms, alternative splicing is an important process that can generate multiple transcripts from one same precursor messenger RNA, which greatly increase transcriptome and proteome diversity. This process is carried out by a super-protein complex defined as the spliceosome. Specifically, splicing factor 1/branchpoint binding protein (SF1/BBP) is a single protein that can bind to the intronic branchpoint sequence (BPS), connecting the 5' and 3' splice site binding complexes during early spliceosome assembly. The molecular function of this protein has been extensively investigated in yeast, metazoa and mammals. However, its counterpart in plants has been seldomly reported. To this end, we conducted a systematic characterization of the SF1 gene family across plant lineages. In this work, a total of 92 sequences from 59 plant species were identified. Phylogenetic relationships of these sequences were constructed, and subsequent bioinformatic analysis suggested that this family likely originated from an ancient gene transposition duplication event. Most plant species were shown to maintain a single copy of this gene. Furthermore, an additional RNA binding motif (RRM) existed in most members of this gene family in comparison to their animal and yeast counterparts, indicating that their potential role was preserved in the plant lineage. Our analysis presents general features of the gene and protein structure of this splicing factor family and will provide fundamental information for further functional studies in plants.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Among eukaryotic organisms, alternative splicing is an important process that can generate multiple transcripts from one same precursor messenger RNA, which greatly increase transcriptome and proteome diversity.\"]}"}]}

Alternative splicing (AS) is a pre-mRNA maturation process leading to the expression of multiple mRNA variants from the same primary transcript. More than 90% of human genes are expressed via AS. Therefore, quantifying the inclusion level of every exon is crucial for generating accurate transcriptomic maps and studying the regulation of AS. Here we introduce SpliceTrap, a method to quantify exon inclusion levels using paired-end RNA-seq data. Unlike other tools, which focus on full-length transcript isoforms, SpliceTrap approaches the expression-level estimation of each exon as an independent Bayesian inference problem. In addition, SpliceTrap can identify major classes of alternative splicing events under a single cellular condition, without requiring a background set of reads to estimate relative splicing changes. We tested SpliceTrap both by simulation and real data analysis, and compared it to state-of-the-art tools for transcript quantification. SpliceTrap demonstrated improved accuracy, robustness and reliability in quantifying exon-inclusion ratios. SpliceTrap is a useful tool to study alternative splicing regulation, especially for accurate quantification of local exon-inclusion ratios from RNA-seq data. SpliceTrap can be implemented online through the CSH Galaxy server http://cancan.cshl.edu/splicetrap and is also available for download and installation at http://rulai.cshl.edu/splicetrap/. michael.zhang@utdallas.edu. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Alternative splicing (AS) is a pre-mRNA maturation process leading to the expression of multiple mRNA variants from the same primary transcript.\"]}"}]}

Alternative splicing (AS) is a process that produces various mRNA splicing isoforms via different splicing patterns of mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs). AS is the primary mechanism for increasing the types and quantities of proteins to improve biodiversity and influence multiple biological processes, including chromatin modification, signal transduction, and protein expression. It has been reported that AS is involved in the tumorigenesis and development of colorectal carcinoma (CRC). In this review, we delineate the concept, types, regulatory processes, and technical advances of AS and focus on the role of AS in CRC initiation, progression, treatment, and prognosis. This summary of the current knowledge about AS will contribute to our understanding of CRC initiation and development. This study will help in the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CRC prognosis and treatment.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Alternative splicing (AS) is a process that produces various mRNA splicing isoforms via different splicing patterns of mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs).

A major goal of evolutionary genetics is to understand the genetic processes that give rise to phenotypic diversity in multicellular organisms. Alternative splicing generates multiple transcripts from a single gene, enriching the diversity of proteins and phenotypic traits. It is well established that alternative splicing contributes to key innovations over long evolutionary timescales, such as brain development in bilaterians. However, recent developments in long-read sequencing and the generation of high-quality genome assemblies for diverse organisms has facilitated comparisons of splicing profiles between closely related species, providing insights into how alternative splicing evolves over shorter timescales. Although most splicing variants are probably non-functional, alternative splicing is nonetheless emerging as a dynamic, evolutionarily labile process that can facilitate adaptation and contribute to species divergence.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Alternative splicing generates multiple transcripts from a single gene, enriching the diversity of proteins and phenotypic traits.\"]}"}]}

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) reduce febrile neutropaenia (FN) incidence but may be used inconsistently in current practice (CP). This study compared the efficacy of pegfilgrastim primary prophylaxis (PPP) with CP neutropaenia management in breast cancer. Individual patient data (N=2282) from 11 clinical trials and observational studies using chemotherapy regimens with > or =15% FN risk and PPP (6 mg, all cycles) or CP (no G-CSF or any cycle G-CSF/pegfilgrastim) were included in an integrated analysis. Most patients received docetaxel-containing regimens. A generalised linear mixed model was fitted (N=2210). Neutropaenia prophylaxis (PPP versus CP), age and disease stage influenced the incidence of FN. Overall, FN was less frequent with PPP than with CP (odds ratio [OR]: 0.124; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08, 0.194; P<0.0001). Odds for cycle 1 FN, dose reductions > or =15% and FN-related hospitalisation were also significantly lower with PPP. These data support PPP in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with moderately high/high FN risk.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity. The correlation found between these two lipid mediators indicating a link between oxidative stress and airway inflammation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

We developed a stable, sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on the synthesis of a new sol-gel material with the ion-exchange capacity sol-gel to coimmobilize the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and enzyme.

The thymus is critical for central tolerance and diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire development, to provide lifelong defense against pathogens while maintaining self-tolerance. Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects.

Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

This study assessed radiotherapy combined with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in patients with primary, inextirpable colorectal adenocarcinoma. Forty-nine patients entered the trial. Two cycles of XELOX (capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) bid d1-14+oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) d1, q3w) were followed by radiotherapy (50.4 Gy), combined with capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) bid every radiotherapy day and oxaliplatin 60 mg/m(2) once weekly. The primary end-point was objective response. Forty-seven patients were evaluable. Twenty-nine (62% [95% CI: 46-75%]) achieved complete or partial response. Thirty-eight (81%) went through surgery of whom 37 (97%) had an R0 resection and five (13%) had a pathological complete response. Seventy-eight percent were alive and estimated local progression rate was 11% at 2 years. The most common grade 3+ toxicity during chemoradiotherapy was diarrhoea (24%).

Probing microarray assays in the presence of a hybridization mix retrieves precious information on hybridization kinetics. However, in common detection schemes, useful surface signals compete with the high supernatant background from labelled targets in the mix. A known solution consists in exciting specifically the microarray surface with evanescent fields. Configurations using planar optical waveguides to produce such fields are shown here to present also a dramatic excitation irradiance enhancement at the guide/surrounding matter interface. We compare theoretically and experimentally a guided excitation with a classical external excitation. A full electromagnetic analysis predicts an irradiance increase higher than 10(4) for adequately tailored waveguides. We deposited high-index TiO(2) sol-gel waveguides on glass substrates according to best simulations. Quantitative enhancement analysis exploiting actual biological fluorescent spots perfectly confirms the irradiance amplification effect of a thin waveguide. The impact of amplification on the design of biochip readers is discussed since it leaves ample margin for simple and low-cost light couplers, advantageous in affordable readers and sensor systems.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the prototype of primary humoral immunodeficiencies. Long-term follow-up studies regarding disease-related complications and outcome are scarce. Our aim was to describe the natural history of XLA. A nationwide multicenter study based on the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry was established in 2000 in Italy. Affected patients were enrolled by documenting centers, and the patients' laboratory, clinical, and imaging data were recorded on an annual base. Data on the patients (N\u00a0= 168) were derived from a cumulative follow-up of 1370 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 8.35 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis decreased after establishment of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry (84 months before vs 23 months after). Respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent clinical symptoms at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Regular immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduced the incidence of invasive infections. Affected patients developed chronic lung disease over time (47% after 40 years of follow-up) in the presence of chronic sinusitis (84%). Malignancies were documented in a minority of cases (3.7%). Overall survival for affected patients was significantly reduced when compared with that for the healthy male Italian population, and it further deteriorated in the presence of chronic lung disease. This is the first detailed long-term follow-up study for patients with XLA, revealing that although immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduces the incidence of invasive infections, it does not appear to influence the development of chronic lung disease. The overall survival of affected patients is reduced. Further studies are warranted to improve patients' clinical management and increase awareness among physicians.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

A novel automated chemiluminescence (CL) read-out system for analytical flow-through microarrays based on multiplexed immunoassays has been developed. The microarray chip reader (MCR 3) is designed as a stand-alone platform, with the goal to quantify multiple analytes in complex matrices of food and liquid samples for field analysis or for routine analytical laboratories. The CL microarray platform is a self-contained system for the fully automated multiplexed immunoanalysis: the microarray chip, the fluidic system and the software module enable automated calibration and determination of analyte concentrations during a whole working day. The detection of antibiotics in milk was demonstrated to validate this device. There are few quantitative multi-residue detection methods for routine analysis although the EU has defined maximum residue limits (MRLs) for a number of antibacterial reagents. Therefore, an automated multianalyte detection instrument is needed quantifying simultaneously antibiotics within some minutes. Also regeneration is required to avoid replacing the assay surface. The MCR 3 uses a microarray chip, which consists of two channels for parallel measurement and regeneration. The microarray chip is designed for parallel analysis of up to 13 different antibiotics in milk applying an indirect competitive microarray immunoassay (MIA). Microspotted antibiotics are directly coupled to epoxylated PEG surfaces. As an initial example, penicillin G is quantified in milk on the MCR 3. The penicillin G surface is regenerable for 47 measurement cycles per channel. A limit of detection (LOD) of 1.1 microg/L is achieved by an assay time of 6 min.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

RNA splicing is widely dysregulated in cancer, frequently due to altered expression or activity of splicing factors (SFs). Microexons are extremely small exons (3-27 nucleotides long) that are highly evolutionarily conserved and play critical roles in promoting neuronal differentiation and development. Inclusion of microexons in mRNA transcripts is mediated by the SF Serine/Arginine Repetitive Matrix 4 (SRRM4), whose expression is largely restricted to neural tissues. However, microexons have been largely overlooked in prior analyses of splicing in cancer, as their small size necessitates specialized computational approaches for their detection. Here, we demonstrate that despite having low expression in normal nonneural tissues, SRRM4 is further silenced in tumors, resulting in the suppression of normal microexon inclusion. Remarkably, SRRM4 is the most consistently silenced SF across all tumor types analyzed, implying a general advantage of microexon down-regulation in cancer independent of its tissue of origin. We show that this silencing is favorable for tumor growth, as decreased SRRM4 expression in tumors is correlated with an increase in mitotic gene expression, and up-regulation of SRRM4 in cancer cell lines dose-dependently inhibits proliferation in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model. Further, this proliferation inhibition is accompanied by induction of neural-like expression and splicing patterns in cancer cells, suggesting that SRRM4 expression shifts the cell state away from proliferation and toward differentiation. We therefore conclude that SRRM4 acts as a proliferation brake, and tumors gain a selective advantage by cutting off this brake.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Silencing of SRRM4 suppresses microexon inclusion and promotes tumor growth across cancers.\", \"We show that this silencing is favorable for tumor growth, as decreased SRRM4 expression in tumors is correlated with an increase in mitotic gene expression, and up-regulation of SRRM4 in cancer cell lines dose-dependently inhibits proliferation in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare progressive disease that is often diagnosed in early childhood and leads to considerably reduced life expectancy; because of its rarity, research literature and patient numbers are limited. To fully characterize the natural history, it is crucial to obtain appropriate estimates of the life expectancy and mortality rates of patients with DMD. A systematic review of the published literature on mortality in DMD up to July 2020 was undertaken, specifically focusing on publications in which Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves with age as a timescale were presented. These were digitized, and individual patient data (IPD) were reconstructed. The pooled IPD were analyzed with the KM estimator and parametric survival analysis models. Estimates were also stratified by birth cohort. Of 1,177 articles identified, 14 publications met the inclusion criteria and provided data on 2,283 patients, of whom 1,049 had died. Median life expectancy was 22.0 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.2, 22.4). Analyses stratified by 3 time periods in which patients were born showed markedly increased life expectancy in more recent patient populations; patients born after 1990 have a median life expectancy of 28.1 years (95% CI 25.1, 30.3). This article presents a full overview of mortality across the lifetime of a patient with DMD and highlights recent improvements in survival. In the absence of large-scale prospective cohort studies or trials reporting mortality data for patients with DMD, extraction of IPD from the literature provides a viable alternative to estimating life expectancy for this patient population.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Analyses stratified by 3 time periods in which patients were born showed markedly increased life expectancy in more recent patient populations; patients born after 1990 have a median life expectancy of 28.1 years (95% CI 25.1, 30.3)\", \"s (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.2, 22.4).

The aim of this nationwide study was to explore the prevalence, life expectancy and leading causes of death in patients with DMD in Sweden. Patients with DMD were identified through the National Quality Registry for Neuromuscular Diseases in Sweden, the Swedish Registry of Respiratory Failure, pathology laboratories, neurology and respiratory clinics, and the national network for neuromuscular diseases. Age and cause of death were retrieved from the Cause of Death Registry and cross-checked with medical records. 373 DMD patients born 1970-2019 were identified, of whom 129 patients deceased during the study period. Point prevalence of adult patients with DMD on December 31st 2019 was 3.2 per 100,000 adult males. Birth prevalence was 19.2 per 100,000 male births. Median survival was 29.9\u00a0years, the leading cause of death being cardiopulmonary in 79.9% of patients. Non-cardiopulmonary causes of death (20.1% of patients) mainly pertained to injury-related pulmonary embolism (1.3 per 1000 person-years), gastrointestinal complications (1.0 per 1000 person-years), stroke (0.6 per 1000 person-years) and unnatural deaths (1.6 per 1000 person-years). Death from non-cardiopulmonary causes occurred at younger ages (mean 21.0\u00a0years, SD 8.2; p\u2009=\u20090.004). Age at loss of independent ambulation did not have significant impact on overall survival (p\u2009=\u20090.26). We found that non-cardiopulmonary causes contribute to higher mortality among younger patients with DMD. We present novel epidemiological data on the increasing population of adult patients with DMD.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe neuromuscular disorder with increasing life expectancy from late teens to over 30\\u00c2\\u00a0years of age.\"]}"}]}

These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

Iron is necessary for essential processes in every cell of the body, but the erythropoietic compartment is a privileged iron consumer. In fact, as a necessary component of hemoglobin and myoglobin, iron assures oxygen distribution; therefore, a considerable amount of iron is required daily for hemoglobin synthesis and erythroid cell proliferation. Therefore, a tight link exists between iron metabolism and erythropoiesis. The liver-derived hormone hepcidin, which controls iron homeostasis via its interaction with the iron exporter ferroportin, coordinates erythropoietic activity and iron homeostasis. When erythropoiesis is enhanced, iron availability to the erythron is mainly ensured by inhibiting hepcidin expression, thereby increasing ferroportin-mediated iron export from both duodenal absorptive cells and reticuloendothelial cells that process old and/or damaged red blood cells. Erythroferrone, a factor produced and secreted by erythroid precursors in response to erythropoietin, has been identified and characterized as a suppressor of hepcidin synthesis to allow iron mobilization and facilitate erythropoiesis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\".

The hormone erythroferrone (ERFE) is produced by erythroid cells in response to hemorrhage, hypoxia, or other erythropoietic stimuli, and it suppresses the hepatic production of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin, thereby mobilizing iron for erythropoiesis. Suppression of hepcidin by ERFE is believed to be mediated by interference with paracrine bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling that regulates hepcidin transcription in hepatocytes. In anemias with ineffective erythropoiesis, ERFE is pathologically overproduced, but its contribution to the clinical manifestations of these anemias is not well understood. We generated 3 lines of transgenic mice with graded erythroid overexpression of ERFE and found that they developed dose-dependent iron overload, impaired hepatic BMP signaling, and relative hepcidin deficiency. These findings add to the evidence that ERFE is a mediator of iron overload in conditions in which ERFE is overproduced, including anemias with ineffective erythropoiesis. At the highest levels of ERFE overexpression, the mice manifested decreased perinatal survival, impaired growth, small hypofunctional kidneys, decreased gonadal fat depots, and neurobehavioral abnormalities, all consistent with impaired organ-specific BMP signaling during development. Neutralizing excessive ERFE in congenital anemias with ineffective erythropoiesis may not only prevent iron overload but may have additional benefits for growth and development.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The hormone erythroferrone (ERFE) is produced by erythroid cells in response to hemorrhage, hypoxia, or other erythropoietic stimuli, and it suppresses the hepatic production of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin\", \"Erythroid overproduction of erythroferrone causes iron overload and developmental abnormalities in mice.\", \"The hormone erythroferrone (ERFE) is produced by erythroid cells in response to hemorrhage, hypoxia, or other erythropoietic stimuli, and it suppresses the hepatic production of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin, thereby mobilizing iron for erythropoiesis.\"]}"}]}

Iron homeostasis ensures adequate iron for biological processes while preventing excessive iron accumulation, which can lead to tissue injury. In mammalian systems, iron availability is controlled by the interaction of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin with ferroportin, a molecule that functions both as the hepcidin receptor as well as the sole known cellular exporter of iron. By reducing iron export through ferroportin to blood plasma, hepcidin inhibits the mobilization of iron from stores and the absorption of dietary iron. Among the many processes requiring iron, erythropoiesis is the most iron-intensive, consuming most iron circulating in blood plasma. Under conditions of enhanced erythropoiesis, more iron is required to provide developing erythroblasts with adequate iron for heme and hemoglobin synthesis. Here the hormone erythroferrone, produced by erythroblasts, acts on hepatocytes to suppress hepcidin production, and thereby increase dietary iron absorption and mobilization from stores. This review focuses on the discovery of erythroferrone and recent advances in understanding the role of this hormone in the regulation of iron homeostasis during states of increased erythropoietic demand. Gaps in our understanding of the role of erythroferrone are highlighted for future study.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Here the hormone erythroferrone, produced by erythroblasts, acts on hepatocytes to suppress hepcidin production, and thereby increase dietary iron absorption and mobilization from stores.\"]}"}]}

Here we developed antibodies against ERFE to prevent hepcidin suppression and to correct the iron loading phenotype in a mouse model of \u03b2-thalassemia [Hbb(th3/+) mice] and used these antibodies as tools to further characterize ERFE's mechanism of action. We show that ERFE binds to BMP6 with nanomolar affinity and binds BMP2 and BMP4 with somewhat weaker affinities. We found that BMP6 binds the N-terminal domain of ERFE, and a polypeptide derived from the N terminus of ERFE was sufficient to cause hepcidin suppression in Huh7 hepatoma cells and in wild-type mice. Anti-ERFE antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain prevented hepcidin suppression in ERFE-treated Huh7 cells and in EPO-treated mice. Finally, we observed a decrease in splenomegaly and serum and liver iron in anti-ERFE-treated Hbb(th3/+) mice, accompanied by an increase in red blood cells and hemoglobin and a decrease in reticulocyte counts. In summary, we show that ERFE binds BMP6 directly and with high affinity, and that antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain of ERFE that prevent ERFE-BMP6 interactions constitute a potential therapeutic tool for iron loading anemias.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Erythroferrone (ERFE) is produced by erythroblasts in response to erythropoietin (EPO) and acts in the liver to prevent hepcidin stimulation by BMP6.\"]}"}]}

The BMP/SMAD pathway in the liver is critical for hepcidin control, and we show that EPO suppressed hepcidin and other BMP target genes in vivo in a partially ERFE-dependent manner. Furthermore, recombinant ERFE suppressed the hepatic BMP/SMAD pathway independently of changes in serum and liver iron. In vitro, ERFE decreased SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD8 phosphorylation and inhibited expression of BMP target genes. ERFE specifically abrogated the induction of hepcidin by BMP5, BMP6, and BMP7 but had little or no effect on hepcidin induction by BMP2, BMP4, BMP9, or activin B. A neutralizing anti-ERFE antibody prevented ERFE from inhibiting hepcidin induction by BMP5, BMP6, and BMP7. Cell-free homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assays showed that BMP5, BMP6, and BMP7 competed with anti-ERFE for binding to ERFE. We conclude that ERFE suppresses hepcidin by inhibiting hepatic BMP/SMAD signaling via preferentially impairing an evolutionarily closely related BMP subgroup of BMP5, BMP6, and BMP7.

Hepcidin, the master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis, tightly influences erythrocyte production. High hepcidin levels block intestinal iron absorption and macrophage iron recycling, causing iron restricted erythropoiesis and anemia. Low hepcidin levels favor bone marrow iron supply for hemoglobin synthesis and red blood cells production. Expanded erythropoiesis, as after hemorrhage or erythropoietin treatment, blocks hepcidin through an acute reduction of transferrin saturation and the release of the erythroblast hormone and hepcidin inhibitor erythroferrone. Quantitatively reduced erythropoiesis, limiting iron consumption, increases transferrin saturation and stimulates hepcidin transcription. Deregulation of hepcidin synthesis is associated with anemia in three conditions: iron refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA), the common anemia of acute and chronic inflammatory disorders, and the extremely rare hepcidin-producing adenomas that may develop in the liver of children with an inborn error of glucose metabolism. Inappropriately high levels of hepcidin cause iron-restricted or even iron-deficient erythropoiesis in all these conditions. Patients with IRIDA or anemia of inflammation do not respond to oral iron supplementation and show a delayed or partial response to intravenous iron. In hepcidin-producing adenomas, anemia is reverted by surgery. Other hepcidin-related anemias are the \"iron loading anemias\" characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and hepcidin suppression. This group of anemias includes thalassemia syndromes, congenital dyserythropoietic anemias, congenital sideroblastic anemias, and some forms of hemolytic anemias as pyruvate kinase deficiency. The paradigm is non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia where the release of erythroferrone from the expanded pool of immature erythroid cells results in hepcidin suppression and secondary iron overload that in turn worsens ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia. In thalassemia murine models, approaches that induce iron restriction ameliorate both anemia and the iron phenotype. Manipulations of hepcidin might benefit all the above-described anemias. Compounds that antagonize hepcidin or its effect may be useful in inflammation and IRIDA, while hepcidin agonists may improve ineffective erythropoiesis. Correcting ineffective erythropoiesis in animal models ameliorates not only anemia but also iron homeostasis by reducing hepcidin inhibition. Some targeted approaches are now in clinical trials: hopefully they will result in novel treatments for a variety of anemias.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The paradigm is non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia where the release of erythroferrone from the expanded pool of immature erythroid cells results in hepcidin suppression and secondary iron overload that in turn worsens ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia.\"]}"}]}

Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group.

Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state.

Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory.

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The Mediator complex is a multi-subunit assembly that appears to be required for regulating expression of most RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcripts, which include protein-coding and most non-coding RNA genes. Mediator and pol II function within the pre-initiation complex (PIC), which consists of Mediator, pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH and is approximately 4.0 MDa in size. Mediator serves as a central scaffold within the PIC and helps regulate pol II activity in ways that remain poorly understood. Mediator is also generally targeted by sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) that work to control gene expression programs in response to developmental or environmental cues. At a basic level, Mediator functions by relaying signals from TFs directly to the pol II enzyme, thereby facilitating TF-dependent regulation of gene expression. Thus, Mediator is essential for converting biological inputs (communicated by TFs) to physiological responses (via changes in gene expression). In this review, we summarize an expansive body of research on the Mediator complex, with an emphasis on yeast and mammalian complexes. We focus on the basics that underlie Mediator function, such as its structure and subunit composition, and describe its broad regulatory influence on gene expression, ranging from chromatin architecture to transcription initiation and elongation, to mRNA processing. We also describe factors that influence Mediator structure and activity, including TFs, non-coding RNAs and the CDK8 module.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The Mediator complex is a multi-subunit assembly that appears to be required for regulating expression of most RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcripts, which include protein-coding and most non-coding RNA genes. \", \"At a basic level, Mediator functions by relaying signals from TFs directly to the pol II enzyme, thereby facilitating TF-dependent regulation of gene expression.

Mediator is a conserved, multi-subunit macromolecular machine divided structurally into head, middle, and tail modules, along with a transiently associating kinase module. Mediator functions as an integrator of transcriptional regulatory activity by interacting with DNA-bound transcription factors and with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to both activate and repress gene expression. Mediator has been shown to affect multiple steps in transcription, including chromatin looping between enhancers and promoters, pre-initiation complex formation, transcriptional elongation, and mRNA splicing. Individual Mediator subunits participate in regulation of gene expression by the estrogen and androgen receptors and are altered in a number of endocrine cancers, including breast and prostate cancer. In addition to its role in genomic signaling, MED12 has been implicated in non-genomic signaling by interacting with and activating TGF-beta receptor 2 in the cytoplasm. Recent structural studies have revealed extensive inter-domain interactions and complex architecture of the Mediator-Pol II complex, suggesting that Mediator is capable of reorganizing its conformation and composition to fit cellular needs. We propose that alterations in Mediator subunit expression that occur in various cancers could impact the organization and function of Mediator, resulting in changes in gene expression that promote malignancy. A better understanding of the role of Mediator in cancer could reveal new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of Mediator-dependent endocrine cancers, especially in settings of therapy resistance.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Mediator is a conserved, multi-subunit macromolecular machine divided structurally into head, middle, and tail modules, along with a transiently associating kinase module.

The Mediator complex serves a crucial function in gene regulation, forming a link between gene-specific transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. Most protein-coding genes therefore require Mediator complex activity for transcriptional regulation. Given the essential functions performed by Mediator complex proteins in gene regulation, it is not surprising that mutations in Mediator complex genes disrupt animal and plant development. What is more intriguing is that the phenotypes of individual Mediator complex mutants are distinct from each other, demonstrating that certain developmental processes have a greater requirement for specific Mediator complex genes. Additionally, the range of developmental processes that are altered in Mediator complex mutants is broad, affecting a variety of cell types and physiological systems. Gene expression defects in Mediator complex mutants reveal distinct roles for individual Mediator proteins in transcriptional regulation, suggesting that the deletion of one Mediator complex protein does not interfere with transcription in general, but instead alters the expression of specific target genes. Mediator complex proteins may have diverse roles in different organisms as well, as mutants in the same Mediator gene in different species can display dissimilar phenotypes.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The Mediator complex serves a crucial function in gene regulation, forming a link between gene-specific transcription factors and RNA polymerase II.\"]}"}]}

The multi-subunit Mediator complex plays a critical role in gene expression by bridging enhancer-bound transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II machinery. Although experimental case studies suggest differential roles of Mediator subunits, a comprehensive view of the specific set of genes regulated by individual subunits in a developing tissue is still missing. Here we address this fundamental question by focusing on the Med19 subunit and using the Drosophila wing imaginal disc as a developmental model. By coupling auxin-inducible degradation of endogenous Med19 in vivo with RNA-seq, we got access to the early consequences of Med19 elimination on gene expression. Differential gene expression analysis reveals that Med19 is not globally required for mRNA transcription but specifically regulates positively or negatively less than a quarter of the expressed genes. By crossing our transcriptomic data with those of Drosophila gene expression profile database, we found that Med19-dependent genes are highly enriched with spatially-regulated genes while the expression of most constitutively expressed genes is not affected upon Med19 loss. Whereas globally downregulation does not exceed upregulation, we identified a functional class of genes encoding spatially-regulated transcription factors, and more generally developmental regulators, responding unidirectionally to Med19 loss with an expression collapse. Moreover, we show in vivo that the Notch-responsive wingless and the E(spl)-C genes require Med19 for their expression. Combined with experimental evidences suggesting that Med19 could function as a direct transcriptional effector of Notch signaling, our data support a model in which Med19 plays a critical role in the transcriptional activation of developmental genes in response to cell signaling pathways.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The multi-subunit Mediator complex plays a critical role in gene expression by bridging enhancer-bound transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II machinery.\"]}"}]}

The Mediator complex is an essential co-regulator of RNA polymerase II that is conserved throughout eukaryotes. Here we present the first study of Mediator in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. We focused on the Middle domain subunit Med31, the Head domain subunit Med20, and Srb9/Med13 from the Kinase domain. The C. albicans Mediator shares some roles with model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, such as functions in the response to certain stresses and the role of Med31 in the expression of genes regulated by the activator Ace2. The C. albicans Mediator also has additional roles in the transcription of genes associated with virulence, for example genes related to morphogenesis and gene families enriched in pathogens, such as the ALS adhesins. Consistently, Med31, Med20, and Srb9/Med13 contribute to key virulence attributes of C. albicans, filamentation, and biofilm formation; and ALS1 is a biologically relevant target of Med31 for development of biofilms. Furthermore, Med31 affects virulence of C. albicans in the worm infection model. We present evidence that the roles of Med31 and Srb9/Med13 in the expression of the genes encoding cell wall adhesins are different between S. cerevisiae and C. albicans: they are repressors of the FLO genes in S. cerevisiae and are activators of the ALS genes in C. albicans. This suggests that Mediator subunits regulate adhesion in a distinct manner between these two distantly related fungal species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The Mediator complex is an essential co-regulator of RNA polymerase II that is conserved throughout eukaryotes.\"]}"}]}

Alterations in the regulation of gene expression are frequently associated with developmental diseases or cancer. Transcription activation is a key phenomenon in the regulation of gene expression. In all eukaryotes, mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription (Mediator), a large complex with modular organization, is generally required for transcription by RNA polymerase II, and it regulates various steps of this process. The main function of Mediator is to transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation. Recent functional studies of Mediator with the use of structural biology approaches and functional genomics have revealed new insights into Mediator activity and its regulation during transcription initiation, including how Mediator is recruited to transcription regulatory regions and how it interacts and cooperates with PIC components to assist in PIC assembly. Novel roles of Mediator in the control of gene expression have also been revealed by showing its connection to the nuclear pore and linking Mediator to the regulation of gene positioning in the nuclear space. Clear links between Mediator subunits and disease have also encouraged studies to explore targeting of this complex as a potential therapeutic approach in cancer and fungal infections.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Transcription activation is a key phenomenon in the regulation of gene expression.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows.

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease, with the interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 axis currently considered its main pathogenic pathway. Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) is responsible for mediating immune signalling of IL-12, IL-23 and type I interferons, without interfering with other critical systemic functions as other JAK proteins do. This article aims to review the current knowledge on deucravacitinib, a new oral drug that selectively inhibits TYK2, granting it a low risk of off-target effects. After good efficacy and safety results in a phase II, placebo-controlled trial, two phase III, 52-week trials evaluated deucravacitinib 6\u00a0mg against placebo and apremilast-an active comparator. POETYK PSO-1 and PSO-2 involved 1688 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. After 16\u00a0weeks, in both studies, over 50% of patients treated with deucravacitinib reached PASI75, which was significantly superior to placebo and apremilast. In POETYK PSO-1, these results improved until week 24 and were maintained through week 52, with over 65% of patients achieving PASI75 at this point. A reduction in signs and symptoms was also reported by patients, with greater impact on itch. Deucravacitinib was well tolerated and safe. There were no reports of serious infections, thromboembolic events, or laboratory abnormalities, which are a concern among other JAK inhibitors. Persistent efficacy and consistent safety profiles were reported for up to 2\u00a0years. Despite advances in the treatment of psoriasis, namely among biologic agents, an oral, effective and safe new drug can bring several advantages to prescribers and patients. Further investigation is required to understand where to place deucravacitinib among current psoriasis treatment options.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"POETYK PSO-1 and PSO-2 involved 1688 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

Deucravacitinib is an oral, selective tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor that demonstrated therapeutic benefit in a Phase 2 clinical trial of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This analysis was designed to evaluate the effect of deucravacitinib on additional clinical and quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes and assess the relationship between these outcomes in adults with psoriasis. Post-hoc analysis of a 12-week Phase 2 trial was conducted for the three most efficacious dosage groups (3\u00a0mg twice daily, 6\u00a0mg twice daily, 12\u00a0mg once daily) and placebo. Investigator assessments for efficacy included Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), body surface area (BSA) involvement, and static Physician's Global Assessment; QoL was assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Treatment responses and their associations were evaluated over time. Deucravacitinib elicited improvement versus placebo as early as Week 4 for most efficacy measures (including changes in absolute PASI and BSA), with efficacy trends observed from Week 2 to Week 12. Improvements in QoL, assessed by achievement of a DLQI overall score of 0/1 (no effect at all on patient's life), followed a pattern similar to deucravacitinib-related clinical outcomes over 12\u00a0weeks. Overall, patients with greater improvements in psoriasis-related clinical signs and symptoms also reported greater improvement in QoL. However, complete skin clearance was not required for achieving DLQI 0/1. Deucravacitinib treatment produced early response and similar trends in improvements across multiple efficacy assessments and QoL in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Endometriosis is a gynecological disease affecting 6-10% of women of reproductive age. In addition to gynecologic symptoms, endometriosis is associated with various systemic effects, including inflammation, altered body weight, and behavioral changes. Previous murine studies demonstrate that endometriosis is causally inked to increased pain sensitization, behavioral changes, and low body mass index (BMI). One possible cellular target that may mediate some of these findings is the hypocretin/orexin neurons. This neuronal system plays a role in regulating wakefulness/sleep cycles, pain perception, and appetite. We hypothesize that endometriosis alters activity level of the hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) neuronal system. Mice underwent endometriosis induction surgeries (endo) or sham surgeries (sham) for the development of the experimental model. Immunocytochemistry was performed on harvested samples from the lateral hypothalamus, and activation levels of Hcrt cells were examined by quantifying the expression of phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) in these cells after an acute stress in sham and endo mice. Mice with endometriosis had greater Hcrt neurons activation than sham mice. Mice with endometriosis fed with high fat diet showed a lower fat/body weight and fat/lean tissue ratio compared to mice without endometriosis. There was no significant difference in food intake between sham and endometriosis mice. These results demonstrate that endometriosis is associated with low body mass and increased hypocretin/orexin activity, which could be implicated in the behavioral changes and to differences in body composition.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"sensitization, behavioral changes, and low body mass index (BMI).

This circadian clock network regulates the release of many hormones, which in turn influence some of the most vital behavioural functions. Sleep-wake cycles are under strict circadian control with strong influence of rhythmic hormones such as melatonin, cortisol and others. Food intake, in contrast, receives circadian modulation through hormones such as leptin, ghrelin, insulin and orexin. A third behavioural output covered in this review is mating and bonding behaviours, regulated through circadian rhythms in steroid hormones and oxytocin.

A low level of hypocretin-1/orexin-A in the cerebrospinal fluid is sufficient to diagnose narcolepsy type 1, being a highly specific and sensitive biomarker, and the irreversible loss of hypocretin neurons is responsible for the main symptoms of the disease: sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep-related hallucinations and paralysis, and disrupted nocturnal sleep. The process responsible for the destruction of hypocretin neurons is highly suspected to be autoimmune, or dysimmune. Over the last two decades, remarkable progress has been made for the understanding of these mechanisms that were made possible with the development of new techniques. Conversely, narcolepsy type 2 is a less well-defined disorder, with a variable phenotype and evolution, and\u00a0few reliable biomarkers discovered so far. There is a dearth of knowledge about this disorder, and its aetiology remains unclear and needs to be further explored. Treatment of narcolepsy is still nowadays only symptomatic, targeting sleepiness, cataplexy and disrupted nocturnal sleep.

Here, we investigated the role of the orexin-2 receptor in sleep regulation in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period crossover clinical trial using two doses (20 and 50\u2009mg) of a highly selective orexin-2 receptor antagonist (2-SORA) (JNJ-48816274). We used a phase advance model of sleep disruption where sleep initiation is scheduled in the circadian wake maintenance zone. We assessed objective and subjective sleep parameters, pharmacokinetic profiles and residual effects on cognitive performance in 18 healthy male participants without sleep disorders. The phase advance model alone (placebo condition) resulted in disruption of sleep at the beginning of the sleep period compared to baseline sleep (scheduled at habitual time). Compared to placebo, both doses of JNJ-48816274 significantly increased total sleep time, REM sleep duration and sleep efficiency, and reduced latency to persistent sleep, sleep onset latency, and REM latency. All night EEG spectral power density for both NREM and REM sleep were unaffected by either dose. Participants reported significantly better quality of sleep and feeling more refreshed upon awakening following JNJ-48816274 compared to placebo. No significant residual effects on objective performance measures were observed and the compound was well tolerated.

Orexins (hypocretins) are neuropeptides that regulate multiple homeostatic processes, including reward and arousal, in part by exciting serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons, the major source of forebrain serotonin. Here, using mouse brain slices, we found that, instead of simply depolarizing these neurons, orexin-A altered the spike encoding process by increasing the postspike afterhyperpolarization (AHP) via two distinct mechanisms. This orexin-enhanced AHP (oeAHP) was mediated by both OX1 and OX2 receptors, required Ca(2+) influx, reversed near EK, and decayed with two components, the faster of which resulted from enhanced SK channel activation, whereas the slower component decayed like a slow AHP (sAHP), but was not blocked by UCL2077, an antagonist of sAHPs in some neurons. Intracellular phospholipase C inhibition (U73122) blocked the entire oeAHP, but neither component was sensitive to PKC inhibition or altered PKA signaling, unlike classical sAHPs. The enhanced SK current did not depend on IP3-mediated Ca(2+) release but resulted from A-current inhibition and the resultant spike broadening, which increased Ca(2+) influx and Ca(2+)-induced-Ca(2+) release, whereas the slower component was insensitive to these factors. Functionally, the oeAHP slowed and stabilized orexin-induced firing compared with firing produced by a virtual orexin conductance lacking the oeAHP. The oeAHP also reduced steady-state firing rate and firing fidelity in response to stimulation, without affecting the initial rate or fidelity. Collectively, these findings reveal a new orexin action in serotonergic raphe neurons and suggest that, when orexin is released during arousal and reward, it enhances the spike encoding of phasic over tonic inputs, such as those related to sensory, motor, and reward events. Orexin peptides are known to excite neurons via slow postsynaptic depolarizations. Here we elucidate a significant new orexin action that increases and prolongs the postspike afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in 5-HT dorsal raphe neurons and other arousal-system neurons. Our mechanistic studies establish involvement of two distinct Ca(2+)-dependent AHP currents dependent on phospholipase C signaling but independent of IP3 or PKC. Our functional studies establish that this action preserves responsiveness to phasic inputs while attenuating responsiveness to tonic inputs. Thus, our findings bring new insight into the actions of an important neuropeptide and indicate that, in addition to producing excitation, orexins can tune postsynaptic excitability to better encode the phasic sensory, motor, and reward signals expected during aroused states.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"UNLABELLED: Orexins (hypocretins) are neuropeptides that regulate multiple homeostatic processes, including reward and arousal, in part by exciting serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons, the major source of forebrai\"]}"}]}

The hypothalamus monitors body homeostasis and regulates various behaviors such as feeding, thermogenesis, and sleeping. Orexins (also known as hypocretins) were identified as endogenous ligands for two orphan G-protein-coupled receptors in the lateral hypothalamic area. They were initially recognized as regulators of feeding behavior, but they are mainly regarded as key modulators of the sleep/wakefulness cycle. Orexins activate orexin neurons, monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the hypothalamus/brainstem regions, to maintain a long, consolidated awake period. Anatomical studies of neural projections from/to orexin neurons and phenotypic characterization of transgenic mice revealed various roles for orexin neurons in the coordination of emotion, energy homeostasis, reward system, and arousal. For example, orexin neurons are regulated by peripheral metabolic cues, including ghrelin, leptin, and glucose concentration. This suggests that they may provide a link between energy homeostasis and arousal states. A link between the limbic system and orexin neurons might be important for increasing vigilance during emotional stimuli. Orexins are also involved in reward systems and the mechanisms of drug addiction. These findings suggest that orexin neurons sense the outer and inner environment of the body and maintain the proper wakefulness level of animals for survival. This review discusses the mechanism by which orexins maintain sleep/wakefulness states and how this mechanism relates to other systems that regulate emotion, reward, and energy homeostasis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"This review discusses the mechanism by which orexins maintain sleep/wakefulness states and how this mechanism relates to other systems that regulate emotion, reward, and energy homeostasis.\"]}"}]}

Central orexin/hypocretin neurons promote wakefulness, feeding and reward-seeking, and control blood glucose levels by regulating sympathetic outflow to the periphery. Glucose itself directly suppresses the electrical activity and cytosolic calcium levels of orexin cells. Recent in vitro studies suggested that glucose inhibition of orexin cells may be mechanistically unusual, because it persists under conditions where glucose metabolism is unlikely. To investigate this further, and to clarify whether background metabolic state regulates orexin cell glucosensing, here we analysed glucose responses of orexin cells in mouse brain slices, in the presence and absence of metabolic inhibitors and physiological energy substrates. Consistent with their documented insensitivity to glucokinase inhibitors, the glucose responses of orexin cells persisted in the presence of the mitochondrial poison oligomycin or the glial toxin fluoroacetate. Unexpectedly, in the presence of oligomycin, the magnitude of the glucose response was significantly enhanced. In turn, 2-deoxyglucose, a non-metabolizable glucose analogue, elicited larger responses than glucose. Conversely, intracellular pyruvate dose-dependently suppressed the glucose responses, an effect that was blocked by oligomycin. The glucose responses were also suppressed by intracellular lactate and ATP. Our new data suggest that other energy substrates not only fail to mimic the orexin glucose response, but paradoxically suppress it in a metabolism-dependent manner. We propose that this unexpected intrinsic property of orexin cells allows them to act as 'conditional glucosensors' that preferentially respond to glucose during reduced background energy levels.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Central orexin/hypocretin neurons promote wakefulness, feeding and reward-seeking, and control blood glucose levels by regulating sympathetic outflow to the periphery.\"]}"}]}

The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is classically implicated in sleep-wake control. It is the main source of orexin/hypocretin and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neuropeptides in the brain, which have been both implicated in arousal state switching. These neuropeptides are produced by non-overlapping LH neurons, which both project widely throughout the brain, where release of orexin and MCH activates specific postsynaptic G-protein-coupled receptors. Optogenetic manipulations of orexin and MCH neurons during sleep indicate that they promote awakening and REM sleep, respectively. However, recordings from orexin and MCH neurons in awake, moving animals suggest that they also act outside sleep/wake switching. Here, we review recent studies showing that both orexin and MCH neurons can rapidly (sub-second-timescale) change their firing when awake animals experience external stimuli, or during self-paced exploration of objects and places. However, the sensory-behavioral correlates of orexin and MCH neural activation can be quite different. Orexin neurons are generally more dynamic, with about 2/3rds of them activated before and during self-initiated running, and most activated by sensory stimulation across sensory modalities. MCH neurons are activated in a more select manner, for example upon self-paced investigation of novel objects and by certain other novel stimuli. We discuss optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations of orexin and MCH neurons, which combined with pharmacological blockade of orexin and MCH receptors, imply that these rapid LH dynamics shape fundamental cognitive and motor processes due to orexin and MCH neuropeptide actions in the awake brain. Finally, we contemplate whether the awake control of psychomotor brain functions by orexin and MCH are distinct from their \"arousal\" effects.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Orexin/Hypocretin and MCH Neurons: Cognitive and Motor Roles Beyond Arousal.\"]}"}]}

Nicotine acts through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to alter firing rate of neurons throughout the brain, leading to addiction-related behaviors. While nAChRs are expressed in the hypothalamus and cholinergic fibers project to this structure, it is unclear how acetylcholine modulates the activity of hypocretin neurons. In this study, we stimulated hypocretin neurons in mouse brain slices with ACh in the presence of atropine to dissect presynaptic and postsynaptic modulation of these neurons through nAChRs. Approximately one-third of tested hypocretin neurons responded to pressure application of ACh (1 mM) with an increase in firing frequency. Stimulation of postsynaptic nAChRs with ACh or nicotine resulted in a highly variable inward current in approximately one-third of hypocretin neurons.

We show that a subset of neurons in the gut which also express leptin receptors display orexin-like immunoreactivity and express functional orexin receptors. Orexin excites secretomotor neurons in the guinea pig submucosal plexus and increases motility. Moreover, fasting upregulates the phosphorylated form of cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) in orexin-immunoreactive neurons, indicating a functional response to food status in these cells. Together, these data suggest that orexin in the gut may play an even more intimate role in regulating energy homeostasis than it does in the CNS.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Orexin (hypocretin) appears to play a role in the regulation of energy balances.\"]}"}]}

Orexin neurons (hypocretin neurons) have a critical role in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness, especially in the maintenance of arousal. Here, we revealed that orexin neurons are directly and indirectly activated by orexin via the orexin 2 receptor (OX2R). Orexin B (1 \u03bcM) induced depolarization in orexin neurons, which was still observed in the presence of TTX (1 \u03bcM), AP-5 (50 \u03bcM), and CNQX (20 \u03bcM). In addition, orexin B induced inward currents in the presence of TTX, suggesting a direct activation of orexin neurons. Although orexin B application induced depolarization in orexin neurons of OX1R knock-out mice at comparable levels to wild-type mice, the observation that orexin B failed to depolarize orexin neurons in the OX2R knock-out mice suggested that OX2R was a primary receptor for this response. Moreover, immunoelectron microscopic analyses revealed direct contacts among orexin neurons, which exhibited structural similarities to the glutamatergic synapses. Together, these results suggest that orexin neurons form a positive-feedback circuit through indirect and direct pathways, which results in the preservation of the orexin neuron network at a high activity level and/or for a longer period. Therefore, the activation of orexin neurons through OX2R might have an important role in the maintenance of arousal.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Orexin neurons (hypocretin neurons) have a critical role in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness, especially in the maintenance of arousal.\"]}"}]}

The orexin-A/hypocretin-1 and orexin-B/hypocretin-2 are neuropeptides synthesized by a cluster of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical area. Orexin neurons receive a variety of signals related to environmental, physiological and emotional stimuli, and project broadly to the entire CNS. Orexin neurons are \"multi-tasking\" neurons regulating a set of vital body functions, including sleep/wake states, feeding behavior, energy homeostasis, reward systems, cognition and mood. Furthermore, a dysfunction of orexinergic system may underlie different pathological conditions. A selective loss orexin neurons was found in narcolepsia, supporting the crucial role of orexins in maintaining wakefulness. In animal models, orexin deficiency lead to obesity even if the consume of calories is lower than wildtype counterpart. Reduced physical activity appears the main cause of weight gain in these models resulting in energy imbalance. Orexin signaling promotes obesity resistance via enhanced spontaneous physical activity and energy expenditure regulation and the deficiency/dysfunction in orexins system lead to obesity in animal models despite of lower calories intake than wildtype associated with reduced physical activity. Interestingly, orexinergic neurons show connections to regions involved in cognition and mood regulation, including hippocampus. Orexins enhance hippocampal neurogenesis and improve spatial learning and memory abilities, and mood. Conversely, orexin deficiency results in learning and memory deficits, and depression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Orexin neurons are \\\"multi-tasking\\\" neurons regulating a set of vital body functions, including sleep/wake states, feeding behavior, energy homeostasis, reward systems, cognition and mood.\"]}"}]}

Orexins (synonymous with hypocretins) are recently discovered neuropeptides made exclusively in hypothalamus. Behavioral, anatomical, and neurophysiological studies show that a subset of these cells, specifically those in lateral hypothalamus (LH), are involved in reward processing and addictive behaviors. Fos expression in LH orexin neurons varied in proportion to conditioned place preference (CPP) for morphine, cocaine, or food. This relationship occurred both in drug-na\u00efve rats and in animals during protracted morphine withdrawal, when drug preference was elevated but food preference was decreased. Inputs to the LH orexin cell field from lateral septum and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis were Fos-activated during cocaine CPP in proportion to the preference expressed in each animal. This implies that these inputs may be involved in driving the conditioned responses in LH orexin neurons. Related studies showed that LH orexin neurons that project to ventral tegmental area (VTA) had greater Fos induction in association with elevated morphine preference during protracted withdrawal than non-VTA-projecting orexin neurons, indicating that the VTA is an important site of action for orexin's role in reward processing. In addition, stimulation of LH orexin neurons, or microinjection of orexin into VTA, reinstated an extinguished morphine preference. In self-administration studies, the orexin 1 receptor antagonist SB-334867 (SB) blocked cocaine-seeking induced by discrete or contextual cues previously associated with cocaine, but not by a priming injection of cocaine. There was no effect of SB on cocaine self-administration itself, indicating that it did not interfere with the drug's reinforcing properties. Neurophysiological studies revealed that locally applied orexin often augmented responses of VTA dopamine (DA) neurons to activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), consistent with the view that orexin facilitates activation of VTA DA neurons by stimulus-reward associations. This LH-to-VTA orexin pathway was found to be necessary for learning a morphine place preference. These findings are consistent with results showing that orexin facilitates glutamate-mediated responses, and is necessary for glutamate-dependent long-term potentiation in VTA DA neurons. We surmise from these studies that LH orexin neurons play an important role in reward processing and addiction and that LH orexin cells are an important input to VTA for behavioral effects associated with reward-paired stimuli.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Orexins (synonymous with hypocretins) are recently discovered neuropeptides made exclusively in hypothalamus.

Orexin A (OXA) and orexin B (OXB) are recently discovered neuropeptides that appear to play a role in various distinct functions such as arousal and the sleep-wake cycle as well as on appetite and regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis. Orexins were first described as neuropeptides expressed by a specific population of neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area, a region classically implicated in feeding behaviour. Orexin neurons project to numerous brain regions, where orexin receptors have been shown to be widely distributed: both OXA and OXB act through two subtypes of receptors (OX1R and OX2R) that belong to the G protein-coupled superfamily of receptors. Growing evidence indicates that orexins act in the central nervous system also to regulate gastrointestinal functions: animal studies have indeed demonstrated that centrally-injected orexins or endogenously released orexins in the brain stimulates gastric secretion and influence gastrointestinal motility. The subsequent identification of orexins and their receptors in the enteric nervous system (including the myenteric and the submucosal plexuses) as well as in mucosa and smooth muscles has suggested that these neuropeptides may also play a local action. In this view, emerging studies indicate that orexins also exert region-specific contractile or relaxant effects on isolated gut preparations. The aim of the proposed review is to summarize both centrally- and peripherally-mediated actions of orexins on gastrointestinal functions and to discuss the related physiological role on the basis of the most recent findings.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Orexin A (OXA) and orexin B (OXB) are recently discovered neuropeptides that appear to play a role in various distinct functions such as arousal and the sleep-wake cycle as well as on appetite and regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

We developed a stable, sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on the synthesis of a new sol-gel material with the ion-exchange capacity sol-gel to coimmobilize the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and enzyme. The partial sulfonated (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane sol-gel (PSSG) film acted as both an ion exchanger for the immobilization of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and a matrix to immobilize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The AuNPs/PSSG/Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) film modified electrode allowed sensitive the ECL detection of NADH as low as 1 nM. Such an ability of AuNPs/PSSG/Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) film to promote the electron transfer between Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and the electrode suggested a new, promising biocompatible platform for the development of dehydrogenase-based ECL biosensors. With alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) as a model, we then constructed an ethanol biosensor, which had a linear range of 5 microM to 5.2 mM with a detection limit of 12nM.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity. The correlation found between these two lipid mediators indicating a link between oxidative stress and airway inflammation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The stability of epigenetic patterns is critical for genome integrity and gene expression. This highly coordinated process involves interrelated positive and negative regulators that impact distinct epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation and dimethylation at histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2). In Arabidopsis, mutations in the DNA methyltransferase MET1, which maintains CG methylation, result in aberrant patterns of other epigenetic marks, including ectopic non-CG methylation and the relocation of H3K9me2 from heterochromatin into gene-rich chromosome regions. Here, we show that the expression of the H3K9 demethylase IBM1 (increase in BONSAI methylation 1) requires DNA methylation. Surprisingly, the regulatory methylated region is contained in an unusually large intron that is conserved in IBM1 orthologues. The re-establishment of IBM1 expression in met1 mutants restored the wild-type H3K9me2 nuclear patterns, non-CG DNA methylation and transcriptional patterns at selected loci, which included DNA demethylase genes. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for long-standing puzzling observations in met1 mutants and reveal yet another layer of control in the interplay between DNA methylation and histone modification, which stabilizes DNA methylation patterns at genes.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Here, we show that the expression of the H3K9 demethylase IBM1 (increase in BONSAI methylation 1) requires DNA methylation.

Heterochromatin is widespread in eukaryotic genomes and has diverse impacts depending on its genomic context. Previous studies have shown that a protein complex, the ASI1-AIPP1-EDM2 (AAE) complex, participates in polyadenylation regulation of several intronic heterochromatin-containing genes. However, the genome-wide functions of AAE are still unknown. Here, we show that the ASI1 and EDM2 mostly target the common genomic regions on a genome-wide level and preferentially interacts with genetic heterochromatin. Polyadenylation (poly(A) sequencing reveals that AAE complex has a substantial influence on poly(A) site usage of heterochromatin-containing genes, including not only intronic heterochromatin-containing genes but also the genes showing overlap with heterochromatin. Intriguingly, AAE is also involved in the alternative splicing regulation of a number of heterochromatin-overlapping genes, such as the disease resistance gene RPP4. We provided evidence that genic heterochromatin is indispensable for the recruitment of AAE in polyadenylation and splicing regulation. In addition to conferring RNA processing regulation at genic heterochromatin-containing genes, AAE also targets some transposable elements (TEs) outside of genes (including TEs sandwiched by genes and island TEs) for epigenetic silencing.

In mammals, DNA methylation is associated with aging. However, age-related DNA methylation changes during phase transitions largely remain unstudied in plants. Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) requires a very long time to transition from the vegetative to the floral phase. To comprehensively investigate the association of DNA methylation with aging, we present here single-base-resolution DNA methylation profiles using both high-throughput bisulfite sequencing and single-molecule nanopore-based DNA sequencing, covering the long period of vegetative growth and transition to flowering in moso bamboo. We discovered that CHH methylation gradually accumulates from vegetative to reproductive growth in a time-dependent fashion. Differentially methylated regions, correlating with chronological aging, occurred preferentially at both transcription start sites and transcription termination sites. Genes with CG methylation changes showed an enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) categories in 'vegetative to reproductive phase transition of meristem'. Combining methylation data with mRNA sequencing revealed that DNA methylation in promoters, introns and exons may have different roles in regulating gene expression. Finally, circular RNA (circRNA) sequencing revealed that the flanking introns of circRNAs are hypermethylated and enriched in long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. Together, the observations in this study provide insights into the dynamic DNA methylation and circRNA landscapes, correlating with chronological age, which paves the way to study further the impact of epigenetic factors on flowering in moso bamboo.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Combining methylation data with mRNA sequencing revealed that DNA methylation in promoters, introns and exons may have different roles in regulating gene expression.\"]}"}]}

Regulation of gene expression by DNA methylation in gene promoter regions is well studied; however, the effects of methylation in the gene body (exons and introns) on gene expression are comparatively understudied. Recently, hypermethylation has been implicated in the inclusion of alternatively spliced exons; moreover, exon recognition can be enhanced by recruiting the methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP2) to hypermethylated sites. This study examines whether the methylation status of an intron is correlated with how frequently the intron is retained during splicing using DNA methylation and RNA sequencing data from breast cancer tissue specimens in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Interestingly, hypomethylation of introns is correlated with higher levels of intron expression in mRNA and the methylation level of an intron is inversely correlated with its retention in mRNA from the gene in which it is located. Furthermore, significant population differences were observed in the methylation level of retained introns. In African-American donors, retained introns were not only less methylated compared to European-American donors, but also were more highly expressed. This underscores the need for understanding epigenetic differences in populations and their correlation with breast cancer is an important step toward achieving personalized cancer care.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Interestingly, hypomethylation of introns is correlated with higher levels of intron expression in mRNA and the methylation level of an intron is inversely correlated with its retention in mRNA from the gene in which it is located.\", \"Regulation of gene expression by DNA methylation in gene promoter regions is well studied; however, the effects of methylation in the gene body (exons and introns) on gene expression are comparatively understudied.\"]}"}]}

DNA methylation is an important epigenetic marker associated with gene expression regulation in eukaryotes. While promoter methylation is relatively well characterized, the role of intragenic DNA methylation remains unclear. Here, we investigated the relationship of DNA methylation at exons and flanking introns with gene expression and histone modifications generated from a human fibroblast cell-line and primary B cells. Consistent with previous work we found that intragenic methylation is positively correlated with gene expression and that exons are more highly methylated than their neighboring intronic environment. Intriguingly, in this study we identified a unique subset of hypomethylated exons that demonstrate significantly lower methylation levels than their surrounding introns. Furthermore, we observed a negative correlation between exon methylation and the density of the majority of histone modifications. Specifically, we demonstrate that hypo-methylated exons at highly expressed genes are associated with open chromatin and have a characteristic histone code comprised of significantly high levels of histone markings. Overall, our comprehensive analysis of the human exome supports the presence of regulatory hypomethylated exons in protein coding genes. In particular our results reveal a previously unrecognized diverse and complex role of the epigenetic landscape within the gene body. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Consistent with previous work we found that intragenic methylation is positively correlated with gene expression and that exons are more highly methylated than their neighboring intronic environment.\"]}"}]}

Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Here we have expanded and refined the versatility of luminopsin tools by fusing an alternative luciferase variant with high light emission, Gaussia luciferase mutant GLucM23, to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing channelrhodopsins with increased light sensitivity. The combination of GLucM23 with Volvox channelrhodopsin-1 produced LMO4, while combining GLucM23 with the anion channelrhodopsin iChloC yielded iLMO4. We found efficient activation of these channelrhodopsins in the presence of the luciferase substrate, as indicated by responses measured in both single neurons and in neuronal populations of mice and rats, as well as by changes in male rat behavior during amphetamine-induced rotations.

Although molecular tools for controlling neuronal activity by light have vastly expanded, there are still unmet needs which require development and refinement. For example, light delivery into the brain is still a major practical challenge that hinders potential translation of optogenetics in human patients. In addition, it would be advantageous to manipulate neuronal activity acutely and precisely as well as chronically and non-invasively, using the same genetic construct in animal models. We have previously addressed these challenges by employing bioluminescence and have created a new line of opto-chemogenetic probes termed luminopsins by fusing light-sensing opsins with light-emitting luciferases. In this report, we incorporated Chlamydomonas channelrhodopsin 2 with step-function mutations as the opsin moiety in the new luminopsin fusion protein termed step-function luminopsin (SFLMO). Bioluminescence-induced photocurrent lasted longer than the bioluminescence signal due to very slow deactivation of the mutated channel. In addition, bioluminescence was able to activate most of the channels on the cell surface due to the extremely high light sensitivity of the channel. This efficient channel activation was partly mediated by radiationless bioluminescence resonance energy transfer due to the proximity of luciferase and opsin. To test the utility of SFLMOs in vivo, we transduced the substantia nigra unilaterally via a viral vector in male rats. Injection of the luciferase substrate as well as conventional photostimulation via fiber optics elicited circling behaviors. Thus, SFLMOs expand the current approaches for manipulation of neuronal activity in the brain and add more versatility and practicality to optogenetics in freely behaving animals.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" luminopsins by fusing light-sensing opsins with light-emitting luciferases. \"]}"}]}

Luminopsins are fusion proteins of luciferase and opsin that allow interrogation of neuronal circuits at different temporal and spatial resolutions by choosing either extrinsic physical or intrinsic biological light for its activation. Building on previous development of fusions of wild-type Gaussia luciferase with channelrhodopsin, here we expanded the utility of luminopsins by fusing bright Gaussia luciferase variants with either channelrhodopsin to excite neurons (luminescent opsin, LMO) or a proton pump to inhibit neurons (inhibitory LMO, iLMO). These improved LMOs could reliably activate or silence neurons in vitro and in vivo. Expression of the improved LMO in hippocampal circuits not only enabled mapping of synaptic activation of CA1 neurons with fine spatiotemporal resolution but also could drive rhythmic circuit excitation over a large spatiotemporal scale. Furthermore, virus-mediated expression of either LMO or iLMO in the substantia nigra in vivo produced not only the expected bidirectional control of single unit activity but also opposing effects on circling behavior in response to systemic injection of a luciferase substrate. Thus, although preserving the ability to be activated by external light sources, LMOs expand the use of optogenetics by making the same opsins accessible to noninvasive, chemogenetic control, thereby allowing the same probe to manipulate neuronal activity over a range of spatial and temporal scales. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Luminopsins are fusion proteins of luciferase and opsin that allow interrogation of neuronal circuits at different temporal and spatial resolutions by choosing either extrinsic physical or intrinsic biological light for its activation.\"]}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant.

To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

The last two decades have witnessed a tremendous expansion in our knowledge of the mechanisms employed by eukaryotic cells to control gene activity. A critical insight to transcriptional control mechanisms was provided by the discovery of coactivators, a diverse array of cellular factors that connect sequence-specific DNA binding activators to the general transcriptional machinery, or that help activators and the transcriptional apparatus to navigate through the constraints of chromatin. A number of coactivators have been isolated as large multifunctional complexes, and biochemical, genetic, molecular, and cellular strategies have all contributed to uncovering many of their components, activities, and modes of action. Coactivator functions can be broadly divide into two classes: (a) adaptors that direct activator recruitment of the transcriptional apparatus, (b) chromatin-remodeling or -modifying enzymes. Strikingly, several distinct coactivator complexes nonetheless share many subunits and appear to be assembled in a modular fashion. Such structural and functional modularity could provide the cell with building blocks from which to construct a versatile array of coactivator complexes according to its needs. The extent of functional interplay between these different activities in gene-specific transcriptional regulation is only now becoming apparent, and will remain an active area of research for years to come.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"A critical insight to transcriptional control mechanisms was provided by the discovery of coactivators, a diverse array of cellular factors that connect sequence-specific DNA binding activators to the general transcriptional machinery, or that help activators and the transcriptional apparatus to navigate through the constraints of chromatin.\", \"Coactivator functions can be broadly divide into two classes: (a) adaptors that direct activator recruitment of the transcriptional apparatus, (b) chromatin-remodeling or -modifying enzymes.\"]}"}]}

Steroid hormone receptors are members of a superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. As such they have a DNA binding domain that recognizes specific target gene sequences along with separate transcriptional activation domains. What sets steroid hormone receptors (and other nuclear hormone receptors) apart from other families of sequence specific transcriptional activators is the presence of a ligand binding domain (LBD) that acts as a molecular switch to turn on transcriptional activity when a hormonal ligand induces a conformational change in the receptor. Upon binding hormone, steroid receptors recruit a novel coactivator protein complex with an essential role in receptor-mediated transcriptional activation. Coactivators function as adaptors in a signaling pathway that transmits transcriptional responses from the DNA bound receptor to the basal transcriptional machinery. Hormone agonists induce a conformational change in the carboxyl-terminal transcriptional activation domain, AF-2, that creates a new protein interaction site on the surface of the LBD that is recognized by LXXLL motifs in the p160 family of coactivators. In contrast, steroid antagonists such as the antiestrogen tamoxifen for the estrogen receptor induce an alternate conformation in AF-2 that occludes the coactivator binding site and recruits corepressors that can actively silence steroid responsive genes. Thus, the cellular availability of coactivators and corepressors is an important determinant in the biological response to both steroid hormone agonists and antagonists. This paper provides an update on the properties and mechanism of action of nuclear receptor coactivators, the nature of the coactivator-binding site, and the structural and mechanistic basis for ligand-dependent binding of coactivators to receptors.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Coactivators function as adaptors in a signaling pathway that transmits transcriptional responses from the DNA bound receptor to the basal transcriptional machinery.\"]}"}]}

Coactivators represent a large class of proteins that partner with nuclear receptors and other transcription factors to regulate gene expression. Given their pleiotropic roles in the control of transcription, coactivators have been implicated in a broad range of human disease states, including cancer. This is best typified by the three members of the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family, each of which integrates steroid hormone signaling and growth factor pathways to drive oncogenic gene expression programs in breast, endometrial, ovarian, prostate, and other cancers. Because of this, coactivators represent emerging targets for cancer therapeutics, and efforts are now being made to develop SRC-targeting agents, such as the SI-2 inhibitor and the novel SRC stimulator, MCB-613, that are able to block cancer growth in cell culture and animal model systems. Here, we will discuss the mechanisms through which coactivators drive cancer progression and how targeting coactivators represent a novel conceptual approach to combat tumor growth that is distinct from the use of other targeted therapeutic agents. We also will describe efforts to develop next-generation SRC inhibitors and stimulators that can be taken into the clinic for the treatment of recurrent, drug-resistant cancers.

Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Histone deacetylases are considered promising epigenetic targets for chemical protein degradation due to their diverse roles in physiological cellular functions and in the diseased state. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are bifunctional molecules that hijack the cell's ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). One of the promising targets for this approach is histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), which is highly expressed in several types of cancers and is linked to the aggressiveness of tumors. In the present work, we describe the synthesis of HDAC6 targeting PROTACs based on previously synthesized benzohydroxamates selectively inhibiting HDAC6 and how to assess their activities in different biochemical in vitro assays and in cellular assays.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common lethal cancer, and there is a need for effective therapies. Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) has been increasingly used, but is not supported by guidelines due to a lack of solid evidence. Determine the efficacy and safety of SIRT in HCC across the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages A, B, and C. Consecutive patients that received SIRT between 2006 and 2016 at two centers in Canada were evaluated. We analyzed 132 patients, 12 (9%), 62 (47%), and 58 (44%) belonged to BCLC stages A, B, and C; mean age was 61.2 (SD\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2), and 89% were male. Median survival was 12.4\u00a0months (95% CI 9.6-16.6), and it was different across the stages: 59.7 (95% CI NA), 12.8 (95% CI 10.2-17.5), and 9.3\u00a0months (95% CI 5.9-11.8) in BCLC A, B, and C, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.009). Independent factors associated with survival were previous HCC treatment (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.23-3.27, p\u2009=\u20090.005), bi-lobar disease (HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.30-3.89, p\u2009=\u20090.003), ascites (HR 1.77, 95% CI 0.99-3.13, p\u2009=\u20090.05), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.20, p\u2009=\u20090.01), Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade-3 (HR 2.69, 95% CI 1.22-5.92, p\u2009=\u20090.01), tumor thrombus (HR 2.95, 95% CI 1.65-5.24, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and disease control rate (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.96, p\u2009=\u20090.03). Forty-four (33%) patients developed severe adverse events, and ALBI-3 was associated with higher risk of these events. SIRT has the potential to be used across the BCLC stages in cases with preserved liver function. When using it as a rescue treatment, one should consider variables reflecting liver function, HCC extension, and systemic inflammation, which are associated with mortality.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Independent factors associated with survival were previous HCC treatment (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.23-3.27, p\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2030=\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u20300.005), bi-lobar disease (HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.30-3.89, p\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2030=\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u20300.003), ascites (HR 1.77, 95% CI 0.99-3.13, p\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2030=\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u20300.05), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.20, p\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2030=\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u20300.01), Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade-3 (HR 2.69, 95% CI 1.22-5.92, p\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2030=\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u20300.01), tumor thrombus (HR 2.95, 95% CI 1.65-5.24, p\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2030<\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u20300.001), and disease control rate (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.96, p\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2030=\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u20300.03). \"]}"}]}

Bacteria of oral origin (BO) in the gut are associated with prognosis in patients with cirrhosis. The Greengenes database (gg_13_8) is widely used in microbiome analysis, but the expanded Human Oral Microbiome Database (eHOMD), a specialized database for BO, can add more detailed information. We used each database to evaluate the relationship between the albumin-bilirubin grade (ALBI) and the microbiome in patients with hepatitis C. Eighty patients were classified into the low ALBI group (LA; n\u00a0=\u00a034) or high ALBI group (HA; n\u00a0=\u00a046). Isolated DNA from stool was amplified to target the V3-4 regions of 16S rRNA. The microbiomes of the two groups were compared using gg_13_8 or eHOMD. We evaluated the associations between microbiomes and prognoses using Cox proportional hazards models. At the genus level, the two groups differed significantly regarding 6 (gg_13_8) and 7 (eHOMD) types of bacteria. All types except Akkermansia are classified as BO. Both databases showed an increase in Streptococcus and Veillonella. eHOMD showed a decrease in Fusobacterium and an increase in Fretibacterium; both produce various types of short-chain fatty acids. At the species level, the two groups demonstrated significant differences in 2 (gg_13_8) and 6 (eHOMD) bacterial types. Selenomonas noxia and Streptococcus salivarius were related to poor prognosis in univariate analysis. The HA group demonstrated increased BO, most of which produce lactic acid or acetic acid. The correlation between the microbiome and metabolism might be related to prognosis. eHOMD was a useful database for analyzing BO.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"We used each database to evaluate the relationship between the albumin-bilirubin grade (ALBI) and the microbiome in patients with hepatitis C.\"]}"}]}

Portopulmonary hypertension (PoPH) is a severe complication of chronic liver disease. We aimed to investigate the etiology of chronic liver disease and the factors associated with the severity of PoPH. Echocardiography was undergone in 833 patients with chronic liver disease during 2005-2019 and 13 patients (1.6%) were diagnosed with PoPH in this observational study. At the diagnosis of PoPH, liver function was evaluated by albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score. Severe PoPH was defined as (1) mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP)\u00a0\u226550\u00a0mmHg or (2) mPAP: 35-49\u00a0mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance\u00a0\u2265400\u00a0dyne/s/cm In patients with PoPH, the leading etiology of chronic liver disease was hepatitis C virus (HCV) (46.2% [sustained virological response (SVR): 23.1% and non-SVR: 15.4%]). Severe PoPH was observed in 53.8% of patients and the 5-year survival rate was 48.1%. There was a significant correlation of mPAP with ALBI score (r\u00a0=\u00a00.6456, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0171). In the decision-tree and random forest analyses, the most impacted classifier for severe PoPH was the ALBI score. In patients with ALBI score\u00a0\u2265-1.45, all patients showed severe PoPH, while the prevalence of severe PoPH was 25.0% in patients with ALBI score\u00a0<-1.45. We found that HCV including SVR was the major etiology of chronic liver disease in patients with PoPH. Moreover, we revealed that the ALBI score was the most impacted factor associated with severe PoPH. Thus, ALBI score may be useful for the estimation of pulmonary vascular resistance.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Association between the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score and severity of portopulmonary hypertension (PoPH): A data-mining analysis.\", \"At the diagnosis of PoPH, liver function was evaluated by albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score. \"]}"}]}

Regorafenib is a second-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma after sorafenib-refractory treatment. This study examined the effects of regorafenib administration on hepatic functional reserve and the treatment course after regorafenib discontinuation. This retrospective, multicenter study involved 51 patients treated with regorafenib after sorafenib-refractory treatment for u-HCC at seven institutions before March 2021. Fourteen, 13, and 24 patients were classified based on modified albumin-bilirubin (mALBI) grade 1, 2a, and 2b, respectively. The median survival time and progression-free survival were 16.7 and 3.3\u00a0months, respectively. Only mALBI grade 2b or 3 was significantly associated with survival rate (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.49; p\u00a0=\u00a00.047). A comparison of median ALBI scores at the initiation of regorafenib (-2.35) with those at 4\u00a0weeks (-1.93) revealed a significant relative change (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). After 4\u00a0weeks, grade 1 or 2a persisted in 15 patients (Group 1); grade 1 or 2a deteriorated to 2b in 12 patients (Group 2); grade 2b or 3 before regorafenib administration was present in 22 patients (Group 3); and MST was 33.3, 12.8, and 11.3\u00a0months in the three groups, respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Patients treated with lenvatinib (LEN) (n\u00a0=\u00a027, MST\u00a0=\u00a023.4\u00a0months) after regorafenib had a significantly longer survival time from regorafenib initiation than those not treated with LEN (n\u00a0=\u00a024, 11.8\u00a0months; p\u00a0=\u00a00.043). Hepatic functional reserve significantly declined after regorafenib administration. During regorafenib treatment, favorable hepatic functional reserve before administration and maintenance of favorable hepatic reserve after administration lead to prolonged prognosis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"RESULTS: Fourteen, 13, and 24 patients were classified based on modified albumin-bilirubin (mALBI) grade 1, 2a, and 2b, respectively. \"]}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found.

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

It has been suggested that these agents may benefit infected animals by restoring compromised immune function, thereby allowing the patient to control viral burden and recover from clinical signs.

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a highly fatal disease caused by a virulent feline coronavirus in domestic and wild cats. We have previously reported the synthesis of potent coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitors and the efficacy of a protease inhibitor, GC376, in client-owned cats with FIP. In this study, we studied the effect of the amino acid changes in 3CLpro of feline coronavirus from a feline patient who received antiviral treatment for prolonged duration. We generated recombinant 3CLpro containing the identified amino acid changes (N25S, A252S or K260\u202fN) and determined their susceptibility to protease inhibitors in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. The assay showed that N25S in 3CLpro confers a small change (up to 1.68-fold increase in the 50% inhibitory concentration) in susceptibility to GC376, but other amino acid changes do not affect susceptibility. Modelling of 3CLpro carrying the amino acid changes was conducted to probe the structural basis for these findings. The results of this study may explain the observed absence of clinical resistance to the long-term antiviral treatment in the patients.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a highly fatal disease caused by a virulent feline coronavirus in domestic and wild cats.

Virulent biotypes of feline coronavirus (FCoV), commonly referred to as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), can result in the development of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a typically fatal immune mediated disease for which there is currently no effective antiviral treatment. We previously reported the successful in vitro inhibition of FIPV replication by synthetic siRNA mediated RNA interference (RNAi) in an immortalised cell line (McDonagh et al., 2011). A major challenge facing the development of any antiviral strategy is that of resistance, a problem which is particularly acute for RNAi based therapeutics due to the exquisite sequence specificity of the targeting mechanism. The development of resistance during treatment can be minimised using combination therapy to raise the genetic barrier or using highly potent compounds which result in a more rapid and pronounced reduction in the viral replication rate, thereby reducing the formation of mutant, and potentially resistant viruses. This study investigated the efficacy of combination siRNA therapy and its ability to delay or prevent viral escape. Virus serially passaged through cells treated with a single or dual siRNAs rapidly acquired resistance, with mutations identified in the siRNA target sites. Combination therapy with three siRNA prevented viral escape over the course of five passages. To identify more potent silencing molecules we also compared the efficacy, in terms of potency and duration of action, of canonical versus Dicer-substrate siRNAs for two previously identified effective viral motifs. Dicer-substrate siRNAs showed equivalent or better potency than canonical siRNAs for the target sites investigated, and may be a more appropriate molecule for in vivo use. Combined, these data inform the potential therapeutic application of antiviral RNAi against FIPV. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Combination siRNA therapy against feline coronavirus can delay the emergence of antiviral resistance in vitro.\", \"these data inform the potential therapeutic application of antiviral RNAi against FIPV.\", \"We previously reported the successful in vitro inhibition of FIPV replication by synthetic siRNA mediated RNA interference (RNAi) in an immortalised cell line (McDonagh et al., 2011).\"]}"}]}

Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP virus: FIPV), a feline coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae, causes a fatal disease called FIP in wild and domestic cat species. The genome of coronaviruses encodes a hydrophobic transmembrane protein, the envelope (E) protein. The E protein possesses ion channel activity. Viral proteins with ion channel activity are collectively termed \"viroporins\". Hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), a viroporin inhibitor, can inhibit the ion channel activity of the E protein and replication of several coronaviruses. However, it is not clear whether HMA and other viroporin inhibitors affect replication of FIPV. We examined the effect of HMA and other viroporin inhibitors (DIDS [4,4'-disothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulphonic acid] and amantadine) on infection by FIPV serotypes I and II. HMA treatment drastically decreased the titers of FIPV serotype I strains Black and KU-2 in a dose-dependent manner, but it only slightly decreased the titer of FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146. In contrast, DIDS treatment decreased the titer of FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146 in dose-dependent manner, but it only slightly decreased the titers of FIPV serotype I strains Black and KU-2. We investigated whether there is a difference in ion channel activity of the E protein between viral serotypes using E. coli cells expressing the E protein of FIPV serotypes I and II. No difference was observed, suggesting that a viroporin other than the E protein influences the differences in the actions of HMA and DIDS on FIPV serotypes I and II. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Differential effects of viroporin inhibitors against feline infectious peritonitis virus serotypes I and II.\", \" However, it is not clear whether HMA and other viroporin inhibitors affect replication of FIPV. \", \"e examined the effect of HMA and other viroporin inhibitors (DIDS [4,4'-disothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulphonic acid] and amantadine) on infection by FIPV serotypes I and II.

Coronaviruses infect animals and humans causing a wide range of diseases. The diversity of coronaviruses in many mammalian species is contributed by relatively high mutation and recombination rates during replication. This dynamic nature of coronaviruses may facilitate cross-species transmission and shifts in tissue or cell tropism in a host, resulting in substantial change in virulence. Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) causes inapparent or mild enteritis in cats, but a highly fatal disease, called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), can arise through mutation of FECV to FIP virus (FIPV). The pathogenesis of FIP is intimately associated with immune responses and involves depletion of T cells, features shared by some other coronaviruses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. The increasing risks of highly virulent coronavirus infections in humans or animals call for effective antiviral drugs, but no such measures are yet available. Previously, we have reported the inhibitors that target 3C-like protease (3CLpro) with broad-spectrum activity against important human and animal coronaviruses. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of our 3CLpro inhibitor in laboratory cats with FIP. Experimental FIP is 100% fatal once certain clinical and laboratory signs become apparent. We found that antiviral treatment led to full recovery of cats when treatment was started at a stage of disease that would be otherwise fatal if left untreated. Antiviral treatment was associated with a rapid improvement in fever, ascites, lymphopenia and gross signs of illness and cats returned to normal health within 20 days or less of treatment. Significant reduction in viral titers was also observed in cats. These results indicate that continuous virus replication is required for progression of immune-mediated inflammatory disease of FIP. These findings may provide important insights into devising therapeutic strategies and selection of antiviral compounds for further development for important coronaviruses in animals and humans. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Reversal of the Progression of Fatal Coronavirus Infection in Cats by a Broad-Spectrum Coronavirus Protease Inhibitor.\", \"Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of our 3CLpro inhibitor in laboratory cats with FIP.

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is caused by a mutant biotype of the feline enteric coronavirus. The resulting FIP virus (FIPV) commonly causes central nervous system (CNS) and ocular pathology in cases of noneffusive disease. Over 95% of cats with FIP will succumb to disease in days to months after diagnosis despite a variety of historically used treatments. Recently developed antiviral drugs have shown promise in treatment of nonneurological FIP, but data from neurological FIP cases are limited. Four cases of naturally occurring FIP with CNS involvement were treated with the antiviral nucleoside analogue GS-441524 (5-10 mg/kg) for at least 12\u2009weeks. Cats were monitored serially with physical, neurologic, and ophthalmic examinations. One cat had serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (including feline coronavirus [FCoV]) titers and FCoV reverse transcriptase [RT]-PCR) and serial ocular imaging using Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). All cats had a positive response to treatment. Three cats are alive off treatment (528, 516, and 354\u2009days after treatment initiation) with normal physical and neurologic examinations. One cat was euthanized 216\u2009days after treatment initiation following relapses after primary and secondary treatment. In 1 case, resolution of disease was defined based on normalization of MRI and CSF findings and resolution of cranial and caudal segment disease with ocular imaging. Treatment with GS-441524 shows clinical efficacy and may result in clearance and long-term resolution of neurological FIP.

Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is common among cats living indoors in groups. In about 10% of infected cats, a potentially lethal disease, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) occurs. Virus transmission is faecal-oral. Mutian\u00ae Xraphconn (Mutian X) is a product marketed to treat cats with FIP but is also being used to stop virus shedding, although no clear guidelines exist for its use for this purpose. The aim of this study was to establish the minimum dose and treatment duration required to ensure viral clearance from the faeces of asymptomatic virus-shedding cats. In five multicat households, 29 cats naturally infected with FCoV and actively shedding virus in the faeces were given Mutian X pills. Virus shedding was monitored using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) controlled for faecal inhibitors to ensure sensitivity. Mutian X given orally cleared the virus in 29 cats; although four cats required a repeated course to finally stop virus shedding. A dose of 4\u00a0mg/kg q24 h for four days was found to be the optimal treatment protocol: 2\u00a0mg/kg cleared only 80% of cats. Post-treatment using a sensitive RT-qPCR test was essential to ensure that virus clearance had been achieved, since failure to clear even one cat can result in re-infection of the others. Records of virus shedding by cats before treatment provided a retrospective control: significantly more cats stopped shedding virus after Mutian X than recovered from infection during the control period (p\u00a0<\u00a0.00001). This is the first report of the successful elimination of faecal FCoV shedding in chronically infected cats.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Mutian\\u00c2\\u00ae Xraphconn (Mutian X) is a product marketed to treat cats with FIP but is also being used to stop virus shedding, although no clear guidelines exist for its use for this purpose. \", \"Oral Mutian\\u00c2\\u00aeX stopped faecal feline coronavirus shedding by naturally infected cats.\"]}"}]}

The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of the nucleoside analog GS-441524 for cats suffering from various forms of naturally acquired feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Cats ranged from 3.4-73 months of age (mean 13.6 months); 26 had effusive or dry-to-effusive FIP and five had non-effusive disease. Cats with severe neurological and ocular FIP were not recruited. The group was started on GS-441524 at a dosage of 2.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 weeks and increased when indicated to 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h. Four of the 31 cats that presented with severe disease died or were euthanized within 2-5 days and a fifth cat after 26 days. The 26 remaining cats completed the planned 12 weeks or more of treatment. Eighteen of these 26 cats remain healthy at the time of publication (OnlineFirst, February 2019) after one round of treatment, while eight others suffered disease relapses within 3-84 days. Six of the relapses were non-neurological and two neurological. Three of the eight relapsing cats were treated again at the same dosage, while five cats had the dosage increased from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/kg q24h. The five cats treated a second time at the higher dosage, including one with neurological disease, responded well and also remain healthy at the time of publication. However, one of the three cats re-treated at the original lower dosage relapsed with neurological disease and was euthanized, while the two remaining cats responded favorably but relapsed a second time. These two cats were successfully treated a third time at the higher dosage, producing 25 long-time survivors. One of the 25 successfully treated cats was subsequently euthanized due to presumably unrelated heart disease, while 24 remain healthy.

The main objectives of this study were to investigate the efficacy of the nucleotide analog GS-441524 in combination with the 3C-like protease inhibitor GC376 for the treatment of naturally aquired feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and to test whether their combination shortens the dosing period and improves the cure rate. In total, 46 FIP-affected cats were enrolled in this experiment, including 36 with wet FIP (29 with abdominal effusion, six with thoracic effusion, and one with thoracic+abdominal effusion), and 10 with dry FIP. The cats were aged from 3 to 96 months. Thoracic+abdominal effusion, lymph-node puncture fluid and perirenal puncture fluid was collected from the affected cats for qPCR testing, and all 46 cats were positive for feline coronavirus (FCoV). The cats divided into different dose groups, all treated for 4 weeks: group 1 (GS-441524, 5 mg/kg.sc.q.24 h; GC376, 20 mg/kg.sc.q.12 h), group 2 (GS-441524, 2.5 mg/kg.sc.q.24 h; GC376, 20 mg/kg.sc.q.12 h), group 3 (GS-441524, 2.5 mg/kg.sc.q.24 h; GC376, 10 mg/kg.sc.q.12 h), and group 4 (GS-441524, 5 mg/kg.sc.q.24 h; GC376, 10 mg/kg.sc.q.12 h). After the 4-week combination treatment, 45 of the 46 (97.8%) cats survived, and 43 of those became clinically normal. Two cats required longer (7 to 12 weeks) treatment to achieve full recovery. As of writing (10 months after completion of the trial), all 45 cats were alive and no relapse was observed. GS-441524 combined with GC376 can be safely and effectively used to treat FIP and reduces the treatment period to 4 weeks, with an excellent cure rate.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" and no relapse was observed.Conclusions and relevance: GS-441524 combined with GC376 can be safely and effectively used to treat FIP and reduces the \", \"Objectives: The main objectives of this study were to investigate the efficacy of the nucleotide analog GS-441524 in combination with the 3C-like protease inhibitor GC376 for the treatment of naturally aquired feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and to test whether their combination shortens the dosing period and improves the cure rate\"]}"}]}

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a complex and historically fatal disease, though recent advances in antiviral therapy have uncovered potential treatments. A newer therapeutic option, unlicensed molnupiravir, is being used as a first-line therapy for suspect FIP and as a rescue therapy to treat cats who have persistent or relapsed clinical signs of FIP after GS-441524 and/or GC376 therapy. Using owner-reported data, treatment protocols for 30 cats were documented. The 26 cats treated with unlicensed molnupiravir as a rescue therapy were treated with an average starting dosage of 12.8 mg/kg and an average ending dosage of 14.7 mg/kg twice daily for a median of 12 weeks (IQR = 10-15). In total, 24 of 26 cats were still living disease-free at the time of writing. One cat was euthanized after completing treatment due to a prolonged seizure, and the other cat underwent retreatment for relapsed clinical signs. Few adverse effects were reported, with the most notable-folded ears (1), broken whiskers (1), and severe leukopenia (1)-seen at dosages above 23 mg/kg twice daily. This study provides a proof of principle for the use of molnupiravir in cats and supports the need for future studies to further evaluate molnupiravir as a potentially safe and effective therapy for FIP.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"This study provides a proof of principle for the use of molnupiravir in cats and supports the need for future studies to further evaluate molnupiravir as a potentially safe and effective therapy for FIP.\"]}"}]}

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease with a high morbidity and mortality by the FIP virus (FIPV, virulent feline coronavirus). Several antiviral drugs for FIP have been identified, but many of these are expensive and not available in veterinary medicine. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a drug approved by several countries to treat malaria and immune-mediated diseases in humans, and its antiviral effects on other viral infections (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, dengue virus) have been confirmed. We investigated whether HCQ in association with interferon-\u03c9 (IFN-\u03c9) is effective for FIPV in vitro.

A novel automated chemiluminescence (CL) read-out system for analytical flow-through microarrays based on multiplexed immunoassays has been developed. The microarray chip reader (MCR 3) is designed as a stand-alone platform, with the goal to quantify multiple analytes in complex matrices of food and liquid samples for field analysis or for routine analytical laboratories. The CL microarray platform is a self-contained system for the fully automated multiplexed immunoanalysis: the microarray chip, the fluidic system and the software module enable automated calibration and determination of analyte concentrations during a whole working day. The detection of antibiotics in milk was demonstrated to validate this device. There are few quantitative multi-residue detection methods for routine analysis although the EU has defined maximum residue limits (MRLs) for a number of antibacterial reagents. Therefore, an automated multianalyte detection instrument is needed quantifying simultaneously antibiotics within some minutes. Also regeneration is required to avoid replacing the assay surface. The MCR 3 uses a microarray chip, which consists of two channels for parallel measurement and regeneration. The microarray chip is designed for parallel analysis of up to 13 different antibiotics in milk applying an indirect competitive microarray immunoassay (MIA). Microspotted antibiotics are directly coupled to epoxylated PEG surfaces. As an initial example, penicillin G is quantified in milk on the MCR 3. The penicillin G surface is regenerable for 47 measurement cycles per channel. A limit of detection (LOD) of 1.1 microg/L is achieved by an assay time of 6 min.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Carvedilol suppressed apoptosis of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC through modification of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, whose was associated with an increase of Cav 1.2 protein expression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the prototype of primary humoral immunodeficiencies. Long-term follow-up studies regarding disease-related complications and outcome are scarce. Our aim was to describe the natural history of XLA. A nationwide multicenter study based on the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry was established in 2000 in Italy. Affected patients were enrolled by documenting centers, and the patients' laboratory, clinical, and imaging data were recorded on an annual base. Data on the patients (N\u00a0= 168) were derived from a cumulative follow-up of 1370 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 8.35 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis decreased after establishment of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry (84 months before vs 23 months after). Respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent clinical symptoms at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Regular immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduced the incidence of invasive infections. Affected patients developed chronic lung disease over time (47% after 40 years of follow-up) in the presence of chronic sinusitis (84%). Malignancies were documented in a minority of cases (3.7%). Overall survival for affected patients was significantly reduced when compared with that for the healthy male Italian population, and it further deteriorated in the presence of chronic lung disease. This is the first detailed long-term follow-up study for patients with XLA, revealing that although immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduces the incidence of invasive infections, it does not appear to influence the development of chronic lung disease. The overall survival of affected patients is reduced. Further studies are warranted to improve patients' clinical management and increase awareness among physicians.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

We developed a stable, sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on the synthesis of a new sol-gel material with the ion-exchange capacity sol-gel to coimmobilize the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and enzyme. The partial sulfonated (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane sol-gel (PSSG) film acted as both an ion exchanger for the immobilization of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and a matrix to immobilize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs).

The thymus is critical for central tolerance and diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire development, to provide lifelong defense against pathogens while maintaining self-tolerance. Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

This study compared the efficacy of pegfilgrastim primary prophylaxis (PPP) with CP neutropaenia management in breast cancer. Individual patient data (N=2282) from 11 clinical trials and observational studies using chemotherapy regimens with > or =15% FN risk and PPP (6 mg, all cycles) or CP (no G-CSF or any cycle G-CSF/pegfilgrastim) were included in an integrated analysis. Most patients received docetaxel-containing regimens. A generalised linear mixed model was fitted (N=2210). Neutropaenia prophylaxis (PPP versus CP), age and disease stage influenced the incidence of FN. Overall, FN was less frequent with PPP than with CP (odds ratio [OR]: 0.124; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08, 0.194; P<0.0001). Odds for cycle 1 FN, dose reductions > or =15% and FN-related hospitalisation were also significantly lower with PPP.

Probing microarray assays in the presence of a hybridization mix retrieves precious information on hybridization kinetics. However, in common detection schemes, useful surface signals compete with the high supernatant background from labelled targets in the mix. A known solution consists in exciting specifically the microarray surface with evanescent fields. Configurations using planar optical waveguides to produce such fields are shown here to present also a dramatic excitation irradiance enhancement at the guide/surrounding matter interface. We compare theoretically and experimentally a guided excitation with a classical external excitation. A full electromagnetic analysis predicts an irradiance increase higher than 10(4) for adequately tailored waveguides. We deposited high-index TiO(2) sol-gel waveguides on glass substrates according to best simulations. Quantitative enhancement analysis exploiting actual biological fluorescent spots perfectly confirms the irradiance amplification effect of a thin waveguide. The impact of amplification on the design of biochip readers is discussed since it leaves ample margin for simple and low-cost light couplers, advantageous in affordable readers and sensor systems.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory.

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity. The correlation found between these two lipid mediators indicating a link between oxidative stress and airway inflammation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

COVID-19 is a pandemic viral disease with catastrophic global impact. This disease is more contagious than influenza such that cluster outbreaks occur frequently. If patients with symptoms quickly underwent testing and contact tracing, these outbreaks could be contained. Unfortunately, COVID-19 patients have symptoms similar to other common illnesses. Here, we hypothesize the order of symptom occurrence could help patients and medical professionals more quickly distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases, yet such essential information is largely unavailable. To this end, we apply a Markov Process to a graded partially ordered set based on clinical observations of COVID-19 cases to ascertain the most likely order of discernible symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea) in COVID-19 patients. We then compared the progression of these symptoms in COVID-19 to other respiratory diseases, such as influenza, SARS, and MERS, to observe if the diseases present differently. Our model predicts that influenza initiates with cough, whereas COVID-19 like other coronavirus-related diseases initiates with fever. However, COVID-19 differs from SARS and MERS in the order of gastrointestinal symptoms. Our results support the notion that fever should be used to screen for entry into facilities as regions begin to reopen after the outbreak of Spring 2020. Additionally, our findings suggest that good clinical practice should involve recording the order of symptom occurrence in COVID-19 and other diseases. If such a systemic clinical practice had been standard since ancient diseases, perhaps the transition from local outbreak to pandemic could have been avoided.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Unfortunately, COVID-19 patients have symptoms similar to other common illnesses.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has a clinical presentation ranging from an asymptomatic course to flu-like syndrome up to respiratory failure. Seasonal Influenza, due to the influenza viruses and very common in children, can cause symptoms similar to COVID-19. In order to identify clinical and laboratory characteristics that allow healthcare workers to differentiate COVID-19 from Influenza, we performed a systematic review of the existing literature on the pediatric age. Methods. The research was done via PubMed for articles published from March 2020 to October 2021, combining the MeSH words \"COVID-19\" and \"Influenza\" and \"Children\" and considering the suggestions of the PRISMA Group. The most frequently described symptoms were fever and cough in both groups. In most studies, high fever, cough, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, vomiting, and muscle pain were detected more frequently in the Influenza group. Regarding the value of laboratory tests, the results were mixed. Almost all studies reported significantly lower levels of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in the COVID-19 group than in the Influenza group. In most manuscripts, COVID-19 had a milder course than Influenza. No symptoms are characteristic of a single infectious agent, with flu-like disorders being the most common. In addition, laboratory tests do not help in the differential diagnosis; however, they show a limited inflammatory response in COVID-19, which could explain the fewer complications compared to adulthood, with a less severe clinical course.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"No symptoms are characteristic of a single infectious agent, with flu-like disorders being the most common.\"]}"}]}

The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) not only poses a serious threat to the health of people worldwide but also affects the global economy. The outbreak of COVID-19 began in December 2019, at the same time as the influenza season. However, as the treatments and prognoses of COVID-19 and influenza are different, it is important to accurately differentiate these two different respiratory tract infections on the basis of their respective early-stage characteristics.

We obtained the latest information about COVID-19 and influenza and summarized and compared their biological characteristics, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathological mechanisms, treatments, and prognostic factors. We show that although COVID-19 and influenza are different in many ways, there are numerous similarities; thus, in addition to using nucleic acid-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody-based approaches, clinicians and epidemiologists should distinguish between the two using their respective characteristics in early stages. We should utilize experiences from other epidemics to provide additional guidance for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"We show that although COVID-19 and influenza are different in many ways, there are numerous similarities; thus, in addition to using nucleic acid-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody-based approaches, clinicians and epidemiologists should distinguish between the two using their respective characteristics in early stages.\"]}"}]}

Herein we sought to investigate such differences in patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other respiratory viruses. We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalised adults and children (\u226415 years) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus A/B, RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, parainfluenza viruses, metapneumovirus, seasonal coronaviruses, adenovirus or bocavirus in a respiratory sample at admission between 2011 and 2020. A total of 6321 adult (1721 SARS-CoV-2) and 6379 paediatric (101 SARS-CoV-2) healthcare episodes were included in the study. In adults, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was independently associated with younger age, male sex, overweight/obesity, diabetes and hypertension, tachypnoea as well as better haemodynamic measurements, white cell count, platelet count and creatinine values. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 was associated with higher 30-day mortality as compared with influenza (adjusted HR (aHR) 4.43, 95%\u2009CI 3.51 to 5.59), RSV (aHR 3.81, 95%\u2009CI 2.72 to 5.34) and other respiratory viruses (aHR 3.46, 95%\u2009CI 2.61 to 4.60), as well as higher 90-day mortality, ICU admission, ICU mortality and pulmonary embolism in adults. In children, patients with SARS-CoV-2 were older and had lower prevalence of chronic cardiac and respiratory diseases compared with other viruses.

During this coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, physicians have the important task of risk stratifying patients who present with acute respiratory illnesses. Clinical presentation of COVID-19, however, can be difficult to distinguish from other respiratory viral infections. Thus, identifying clinical features that are strongly associated with COVID-19 in comparison to other respiratory viruses can aid risk stratification and testing prioritization especially in situations where resources for virological testing and resources for isolation facilities are limited. In our retrospective cohort study comparing the clinical presentation of COVID-19 and other respiratory viral infections, we found that anosmia and dysgeusia were symptoms independently associated with COVID-19 and can be important differentiating symptoms in patients presenting with acute respiratory illness. On the other hand, laboratory abnormalities and radiological findings were not statistically different between the two groups. In comparing outcomes, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to need high dependency or intensive care unit care and had a longer median length of stay.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a global health threat with the potential to cause severe disease manifestations in the lungs. Although COVID-19 has been extensively characterized clinically, the factors distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory viruses are unknown. Here, we compared the clinical, histopathological, and immunological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and pandemic influenza A(H1N1). We observed a higher frequency of respiratory symptoms, increased tissue injury markers, and a histological pattern of alveolar pneumonia in pandemic influenza A(H1N1) patients. Conversely, dry cough, gastrointestinal symptoms and interstitial lung pathology were observed in COVID-19 cases. Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) was characterized by higher levels of IL-1RA, TNF-\u03b1, CCL3, G-CSF, APRIL, sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2, sCD30, and sCD163. Meanwhile, COVID-19 displayed an immune profile distinguished by increased Th1 (IL-12, IFN-\u03b3) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13) cytokine levels, along with IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, CCL11, VEGF, TWEAK, TSLP, MMP-1, and MMP-3. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induces a dysbalanced polyfunctional inflammatory response that is different from the immune response against pandemic influenza A(H1N1).

Differential diagnosis of COVID-19 and/or influenza (flu) at point of care is critical for efficient patient management and treatment of both these diseases. The study presented here characterizes the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A+B (\"Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu\") triplex assay. The performance for SARS-CoV-2 detection was determined using 298 specimens from patients reporting COVID-19 symptoms within 7\u2009days from symptom onset (DSO) in comparison with the Lyra SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase PCR) assay (\"Lyra SARS-CoV-2\") as the reference. The performance for flu A and flu B detection was determined using 75 influenza-positive and 40 influenza-negative retrospective specimens in comparison with the previously FDA-cleared BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B assay (\"Veritor Flu\") as the reference. The Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu assay met the FDA EUA acceptance criteria (86.7%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 75.8 to 93.1) for SARS-CoV-2 testing compared to Lyra SARS-CoV-2. The Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu assay also demonstrated 100% agreement with the Veritor Flu for Flu A+B assay. For flu A detection, the lower bound of the 95% CI was 91.2%; for flu B detection, the lower bound was 90.0%. The dual detection capability of Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu for the etiologic agents causing COVID-19 and flu will allow efficient differentiation between the two illnesses, inform disease management, and facilitate optimal treatment. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"COVID-19 and flu are two respiratory illnesses which share similar clinical symptoms.\"]}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects.

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Breast cancer, the most prevalent cancer worldwide,\u00a0consists of 4 main subtypes, namely, Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-positive, and Triple-negative breast cancer\u00a0(TNBC). Triple-negative breast tumors, which do not express estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors,\u00a0account for approximately 15-20% of breast cancer cases. The lack of traditional receptor targets contributes to the\u00a0heterogenous, aggressive, and refractory nature of these tumors, resulting in limited therapeutic strategies. Chemotherapeutics such as taxanes and anthracyclines have been the traditional go to\u00a0treatment regimens for TNBC patients. Paclitaxel, docetaxel, doxorubicin, and epirubicin have been longstanding,\u00a0Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies against TNBC.

Feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy associated with the consumption of feedstuffs contaminated with tissue from bovine spongiform encephalopathy-affected cattle and characterized by the accumulation in the central nervous system of an abnormal isoform of the prion protein (PrP(sc)). Clinically, it presents as a progressive fatal neurologic syndrome that is not easily distinguished from other feline neurologic conditions. Most cases of FSE have been reported in England, where it was first detected in 1990, but a few cases have been reported from other European countries. To identify possible cases of FSE in Italy, the Italian Ministry of Health funded a 2-year surveillance project during which the brains from 110 domestic cats with neurologic signs were evaluated histologically for spongiform encephalopathy and immunohistochemically to detect PrP(sc). Although no cases of FSE were found, the study proved useful in monitoring the Italian cat population for other neurologic diseases: neoplasia (21.8%), toxic-metabolic encephalopathy (18.2%), granulomatous encephalitis (15.5%), suppurative encephalitis (4.6%), trauma (3.6%), circulatory disorders (3.6%), degeneration (2.7%), nonsuppurative encephalitis (2.7%), and neuromuscular diseases (1.8%).

Feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE), affecting domestic and captive feline species, is a prion disease considered to be related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Here we report an immunohistological analysis of the first FSE-affected cheetah born in France. The duration of clinical signs, of which ataxia was the main one, was about 8 weeks. The distribution of abnormal prion protein (PrP(sc)) was studied by immunohistochemistry within 27 different tissues. Different antibodies were used to visualise abnormal PrP deposits in situ. PrP(sc )accumulation was detected in the central nervous system (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brain stem, spinal cord, retina), in peripheral nerves and in lymphoid organs. PrP(sc) deposits were not observed within the enteric nervous system nor in several other organs, such as pancreas, ovary, liver and muscle. More interestingly, unusual PrP(sc )deposits were observed within the zona fasciculata/reticularis of the adrenal gland and within some glomeruli of the kidney raising the question of possible PrP(sc) excretion. The sympathetic innervation of these two organs was visualised and compared to the distribution of PrP(sc) deposits.

In addition, transmission studies to the TgOvPrP4 mouse line were also performed, for comparison with the transmission of cattle BSE. The TgOvPrP4 mouse brains infected with cattle BSE and cheetah FSE revealed similar vacuolar lesion profiles, PrP(d) brain mapping with occurrence of typical florid plaques.

Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant.

To add further complexity, alternative polyadenylation (APA) emerges as a widespread mechanism to regulate gene expression by producing shorter or longer mRNA isoforms that differ in the length of their 3'-UTRs or even coding sequences. Resulting shorter mRNA isoforms generally lack cis-elements where trans-acting factors bind, and hence are differentially regulated compared with the longer isoforms. This review focuses on the RBPs involved in APA regulation and their action mechanisms on APA-generated isoforms.

Many studies using reporter assays have demonstrated that 3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) regulate gene expression by controlling mRNA stability and translation. Due to intrinsic limitations of heterologous reporter assays, we sought to develop a gene editing approach to investigate the regulatory activity of 3'-UTRs in their native context. We initially used dual-CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 targeting to delete DNA regions corresponding to nine chemokine 3'-UTRs that destabilized mRNA in a reporter assay. Targeting six chemokine 3'-UTRs increased chemokine mRNA levels as expected. However, targeting CXCL1, CXCL6 and CXCL8 3'-UTRs unexpectedly led to substantial mRNA decreases. Metabolic labeling assays showed that targeting these three 3'-UTRs increased mRNA stability, as predicted by the reporter assay, while also markedly decreasing transcription, demonstrating an unexpected role for 3'-UTR sequences in transcriptional regulation. We further show that CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of specific 3'-UTR elements can be used for modulating gene expression and for highly parallel localization of active 3'-UTR elements in the native context. Our work demonstrates the duality and complexity of 3'-UTR sequences in regulation of gene expression and provides a useful approach for modulating gene expression and for functional annotation of 3'-UTRs in the native context.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Many studies using reporter assays have demonstrated that 3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) regulate gene expression by controlling mRNA stability and translation.\"]}"}]}

Protozoan parasites are one of the oldest living entities in this world that throughout their existence have shown excellent resilience to the odds of survival and have adapted beautifully to ever changing rigors of the environment. In view of the dynamic environment encountered by them throughout their life cycle, and in establishing pathogenesis, it is unsurprising that modulation of gene expression plays a fundamental role in their survival. In higher eukaryotes, untranslated regions (UTRs) of transcripts are one of the crucial regulators of gene expression (influencing mRNA stability and translation efficiency). Parasitic protozoan genome studies have led to the characterization (in silico, in vitro and in vivo) of a large number of their genes. Comparison of higher eukaryotic UTRs with parasitic protozoan UTRs reveals the existence of several similar and dissimilar facets of the UTRs. This review focuses on the elements of UTRs of medically important protozoan parasites and their regulatory role in gene expression.

The 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of eukaryotic genes regulate mRNA stability, localization and translation. Here, we present evidence that large numbers of 3'UTRs in human, mouse and fly are also expressed separately from the associated protein-coding sequences to which they are normally linked, likely by post-transcriptional cleavage. Analysis of CAGE (capped analysis of gene expression), SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) and cDNA libraries, as well as microarray expression profiles, demonstrate that the independent expression of 3'UTRs is a regulated and conserved genome-wide phenomenon. We characterize the expression of several 3'UTR-derived RNAs (uaRNAs) in detail in mouse embryos, showing by in situ hybridization that these transcripts are expressed in a cell- and subcellular-specific manner. Our results suggest that 3'UTR sequences can function not only in cis to regulate protein expression, but also intrinsically and independently in trans, likely as noncoding RNAs, a conclusion supported by a number of previous genetic studies. Our findings suggest novel functions for 3'UTRs, as well as caution in the use of 3'UTR sequence probes to analyze gene expression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Our results suggest that 3'UTR sequences can function not only in cis to regulate protein expression, but also intrinsically and independently in trans, likely as noncoding RNAs, a conclusion supported by a number of previous genetic studies.\", \"The 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of eukaryotic genes regulate mRNA stability, localization and translation.\"]}"}]}

The 5' and 3' untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs (UTRs) play crucial roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression through the modulation of nucleo-cytoplasmic mRNA transport, translation efficiency, subcellular localization, and message stability. Since 1996, we have developed and maintained UTRdb, a specialized database of UTR sequences. Here we present UTRdb 2.0, a major update of UTRdb featuring an extensive collection of eukaryotic 5' and 3' UTR sequences, including over 26 million entries from over 6 million genes and 573 species, enriched with a curated set of functional annotations. Annotations include CAGE tags and polyA signals to label the completeness of 5' and 3'UTRs, respectively. In addition, uORFs and IRES are annotated in 5'UTRs as well as experimentally validated miRNA targets in 3'UTRs. Further annotations include evolutionarily conserved blocks, Rfam motifs, ADAR-mediated RNA editing events, and m6A modifications. A web interface allowing a flexible selection and retrieval of specific subsets of UTRs, selected according to a combination of criteria, has been implemented which also provides comprehensive download facilities.

Here we map the 3' UTRs of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) using next-generation RNA sequencing, 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), and tiled microarray analyses. Chimeric reporters containing the KSHV 3' UTRs show a general trend toward reduced gene expression under conditions of latent infection. Those 3' UTRs with a higher GC content are more likely to be associated with reduced gene expression. KSHV transcripts display an extensive use of shared polyadenylation sites allowing for partially overlapping 3' UTRs and regulatory activities. In addition, a subset of KSHV 3' UTRs is sufficient to convey increased gene expression under conditions of lytic infection. These results suggest a role for viral 3' UTRs in contributing to differential gene expression during latent versus lytic infection. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"3' untranslated regions (UTRs) are known to play an important role in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression.\"]}"}]}

Untranslated regions (UTR) play important roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA processing. There is a wealth of UTR-related information to be mined from the rapidly accumulating EST collections. A computational tool, UTR-extender, has been developed to infer UTR sequences from genomically aligned ESTs. It can completely and accurately reconstruct 72% of the 3' UTRs and 15% of the 5' UTRs when tested using 908 functionally cloned transcripts. In addition, it predicts extensions for 11% of the 5' UTRs and 28% of the 3' UTRs. These extension regions are validated by examining splicing frequencies and conservation levels. We also developed a method called polyadenylation site scan (PASS) to precisely map polyadenylation sites in human genomic sequences. A PASS analysis of 908 genic regions estimates that 40-50% of human genes undergo alternative polyadenylation. Using EST redundancy to assess expression levels, we also find that genes with short 3' UTRs tend to be highly expressed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Untranslated regions (UTR) play important roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA processing.\"]}"}]}

Untranslated regions (UTRs) in eukaryotes play a significant role in the regulation of translation and mRNA half-life, as well as interacting with specific RNA-binding proteins. However, UTRs receive less attention than more crucial elements such as genes, and the basic structural and evolutionary characteristics of UTRs of different species, and the relationship between these UTRs and the genome size and species gene number is not well understood. To address these questions, we performed a comparative analysis of 5' and 3' untranslated regions of different species by analyzing the basic characteristics of 244,976 UTRs from three eukaryote kingdoms (Plantae, Fungi, and Protista). The results showed that the UTR lengths and SSR frequencies in UTRs increased significantly with increasing species gene number while the length and G+C content in 5' UTRs and different types of repetitive sequences in 3' UTRs increased with the increase of genome size. We also found that the sequence length of 5' UTRs was significantly positively correlated with the presence of transposons and SSRs while the sequence length of 3' UTRs was significantly positively correlated with the presence of tandem repeat sequences. These results suggested that evolution of species complexity from lower organisms to higher organisms is accompanied by an increase in the regulatory complexity of UTRs, mediated by increasing UTR length, increasing G+C content of 5' UTRs, and insertion and expansion of repetitive sequences.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Untranslated regions (UTRs) in eukaryotes play a significant role in the regulation of translation and mRNA half-life, as well as interacting with specific RNA-binding proteins.\"]}"}]}

Untranslated regions (UTRs) of eukaryotic mRNAs play crucial roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression via the modulation of nucleocytoplasmic mRNA transport, translation efficiency, subcellular localization, and message stability. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in UTRs of a candidate gene may also change the post-transcriptional regulation of a gene or function by nucleotide mutation. For species that have not been entirely sequenced genomically, new methods need to be devised to discover SNPs in noncoding regions of candidate genes. In this study, based on the expressed sequence tag (EST) of Pinus radiata (Monterey pine), we obtained all the sequences of UTRs of the actin gene by using a chromosome walking method. We also detected all the SNPs in and around the coding region of the actin gene. In this way, the full genomic sequence (2154 bp) of the actin gene was identified, including the 5&rsquo;UTR, introns, the coding sequence, and the 3&rsquo;UTR. PCR amplification and DNA fragment sequencing from 200 unrelated P. radiata trees revealed a total of 21 SNPs in the actin gene, of which 3 were located in the 5&rsquo;UTR, 3 in the introns, 10 in the coding sequence, and 5 in the 3&rsquo;UTR. We show that chromosome walking can be used for obtaining the sequence of UTRs, and then, based on this sequence, to discover SNPs in the noncoding regions of candidate genes from this species without an entire genomic sequence.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Untranslated regions (UTRs) of eukaryotic mRNAs play crucial roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression via the modulation of nucleocytoplasmic mRNA transport, translation efficiency, subcellular localization, and message stability.\"]}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory.

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively.

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57).

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

We developed a stable, sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on the synthesis of a new sol-gel material with the ion-exchange capacity sol-gel to coimmobilize the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and enzyme. The partial sulfonated (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane sol-gel (PSSG) film acted as both an ion exchanger for the immobilization of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and a matrix to immobilize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs).

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects.

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

Despite recent advances in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, no breakthrough treatments have been discovered. Cholinesterase inhibitors and the NMDA-receptor antagonist memantine are currently the two approved symptomatic treatments for AD. 5-HT6 receptor antagonism has recently emerged as a promising treatment strategy to improve cognition in AD, with a modest side-effect profile. 5-HT6 receptors, exclusively found in the central nervous system, modulate primarily GABA and glutamate levels, facilitating the secondary release of other neurotransmitters including dopamine, noradrenaline, and acetylcholine, all of which are compromised in AD. This review discusses findings of preclinical and phase I-III clinical trials conducted with three major 5-HT6 receptor antagonists: idalopirdine, intepirdine, and SUVN-502, in the field of AD. Despite early positive findings, larger phase-III trials have failed to demonstrate any statistically significant impact on cognition for both idalopirdine and intepirdine, as adjunct to cholinesterase inhibitors. Paradoxically, 5-HT6 receptor agonists have also been shown to have cognitive enhancing properties. Thus, a better understanding of the mechanism of action of the 5-HT6 receptor and its ligands is warranted. Investigating 5-HT6 receptor partial or inverse agonists may be promising in future AD trials.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"EXPERT OPINION: Despite early positive findings, larger phase-III trials have failed to demonstrate any statistically significant impact on cognition for both idalopirdine and intepirdine, as adjunct to cholinesterase inhibitors.\"]}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes.

The highly specific induction of RNA interference-mediated gene knockdown, based on the direct application of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), opens novel avenues towards innovative therapies. Two decades after the discovery of the RNA interference mechanism, the first siRNA drugs received approval for clinical use by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency between 2018 and 2022. These are mainly based on an siRNA conjugation with a targeting moiety for liver hepatocytes, N-acetylgalactosamine, and cover the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria, transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, hypercholesterolemia, and primary hyperoxaluria type 1. Still, the development of siRNA therapeutics faces several challenges and issues, including the definition of optimal siRNAs in terms of target, sequence, and chemical modifications, siRNA delivery to its intended site of action, and the absence of unspecific off-target effects. Further siRNA drugs are in clinical studies, based on different delivery systems and covering a wide range of different pathologies including metabolic diseases, hematology, infectious diseases, oncology, ocular diseases, and others. This article reviews the knowledge on siRNA design and chemical modification, as well as issues related to siRNA delivery that may be addressed using different delivery systems. Details on the mode of action and clinical status of the various siRNA therapeutics are provided, before giving an outlook on issues regarding the future of siRNA drugs and on their potential as one emerging standard modality in pharmacotherapy.

Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are a novel therapeutic approach to target difficult-to-drug protein classes by targeting their corresponding mRNAs. Significantly enhanced ASO activity has been achieved by the targeted delivery of ASOs to selected tissues. One example is the targeted delivery of ASOs to hepatocytes, achieved with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) conjugation to ASO, which results in selective uptake by asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR). Here we have evaluated the potential of GalNAc-conjugated ASOs as a therapeutic approach to targeting difficult-to-drug pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The activity of GalNAc-conjugated ASOs was superior to that of the unconjugated parental ASO in ASGR (+) human HCC cells in\u00a0vitro, but not in ASGR (-) cells. Both human- and mouse-derived HCC displayed reduced levels of ASGR, however, despite this, GalNAc-conjugated ASOs showed a 5- to 10-fold increase in potency in tumors. Systemically administered GalNAc-conjugated ASOs demonstrated both enhanced antisense activity and antitumor activity in the diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC tumor model. Finally, GalNAc conjugation enhanced ASO activity in human circulating tumor cells from HCC patients, demonstrating the potential of this approach in primary human HCC tumor cells. Taken together, these results provide a strong rationale for a potential therapeutic use of GalNAc-conjugated ASOs for the treatment of HCC.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"One example is the targeted delivery of ASOs to hepatocytes, achieved with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) conjugation to ASO, which results in selective uptake by asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR).\"]}"}]}

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are emerging as leading causes of liver disease worldwide. Currently, no specific pharmacologic therapy is available for NAFLD/NASH, which has been recognized as one of the major unmet medical needs of the 21st century. Our recent studies in genetic mouse models, human cell lines, and well-characterized patient cohorts have identified serine/threonine protein kinase (STK)25 as a critical regulator of hepatic lipid partitioning and NAFLD/NASH. Here, we studied the metabolic benefit of liver-specific STK25 inhibitors on NAFLD development and progression in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. We developed a hepatocyte-specific triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-conjugated antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting Stk25 and evaluated its effect on NAFLD features in mice after chronic exposure to dietary lipids. We found that systemic administration of hepatocyte-targeting GalNAc-Stk25 ASO in obese mice effectively ameliorated steatosis, inflammatory infiltration, hepatic stellate cell activation, nutritional fibrosis, and hepatocellular damage in the liver compared with mice treated with GalNAc-conjugated nontargeting ASO, without any systemic toxicity or local tolerability concerns. We also observed protection against high-fat-diet-induced hepatic oxidative stress and improved mitochondrial function with Stk25 ASO treatment in mice. Moreover, GalNAc-Stk25 ASO suppressed lipogenic gene expression and acetyl-CoA carboxylase protein abundance in the liver, providing insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying repression of hepatic steatosis. This study provides in\u00a0vivo nonclinical proof-of-principle for the metabolic benefit of liver-specific inhibition of STK25 in the context of obesity and warrants future investigations to address the therapeutic potential of GalNAc-Stk25 ASO in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"ng and NAFLD/NASH.

Triantennary N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc, GN3: ), a high-affinity ligand for the hepatocyte-specific asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), enhances the potency of second-generation gapmer antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) 6-10-fold in mouse liver. When combined with next-generation ASO designs comprised of short S-cEt (S-2'-O-Et-2',4'-bridged nucleic acid) gapmer ASOs, \u223c 60-fold enhancement in potency relative to the parent MOE (2'-O-methoxyethyl RNA) ASO was observed. GN3: -conjugated ASOs showed high affinity for mouse ASGPR, which results in enhanced ASO delivery to hepatocytes versus non-parenchymal cells. After internalization into cells, the GN3: -ASO conjugate is metabolized to liberate the parent ASO in the liver. No metabolism of the GN3: -ASO conjugate was detected in plasma suggesting that GN3: acts as a hepatocyte targeting prodrug that is detached from the ASO by metabolism after internalization into the liver. GalNAc conjugation also enhanced potency and duration of the effect of two ASOs targeting human apolipoprotein C-III and human transthyretin (TTR) in transgenic mice. The unconjugated ASOs are currently in late stage clinical trials for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia and TTR-mediated polyneuropathy.

TriantennaryN-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc, GN3) and lipophilic ligands such as cholesterol and\u03b1-tocopherol conjugations dramatically improve the distribution and efficacy of second-generation antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in the whole liver. To characterize ligands for delivery to liver cells based on pharmacokinetics and efficacy, we used a locked nucleic acid gapmer of ASO targeting apolipoprotein B as a model compound and evaluated the amount of ASO and apolipoprotein B mRNA in the whole liver, hepatocytes, and nonparenchymal (NP) cells as well as plasma total cholesterol after administration of ASO conjugated with these ligands to mice. Compared with unconjugated ASO, GN3 conjugation increased the amount (7-fold) and efficacy (more than 10-fold) of ASO in hepatocytes only and showed higher efficacy than the increased rate of the amount of ASO. On the other hand, lipophilic ligand conjugations led to increased delivery (3- to 5-fold) and efficacy (5-fold) of ASO to both hepatocytes and NP cells. GN3 and lipophilic ligand conjugations increased the area under the curve of ASOs and the pharmacodynamic duration but did not change the half-life in hepatocytes and NP cells compared with unconjugated ASO. In the liver, the phosphodiester bond between ASO and these ligands was promptly cleaved to liberate unconjugated ASO. These ligand conjugations reduced plasma total cholesterol compared with unconjugated ASO, although these ASOs were well tolerated with no elevation in plasma transaminases. These findings could facilitate ligand selection tailored to liver cells expressed in disease-related genes and could contribute to the discovery and development of RNA interference-based therapy. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"TriantennaryN-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc, GN3) and lipophilic ligands such as cholesterol and\\u00ce\\u00b1-tocopherol conjugations dramatically improve the distribution and efficacy of second-generation antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in the whole liver.\"]}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) protease inhibitor, reduces the risk of hospitalization and death by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but has been associated with symptomatic rebound after therapy completion. Six individuals with relapse of COVID-19 symptoms after treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, 2 individuals with rebound symptoms without prior antiviral therapy and 7 patients with acute Omicron infection (controls) were studied. Soluble biomarkers and serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were measured. Nasal swabs positive for SARS-CoV-2 underwent viral isolation and targeted viral sequencing. SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike, anti-receptor-binding domain, and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies were measured. Surrogate viral neutralization tests against wild-type and Omicron spike protein, as well as T-cell stimulation assays, were performed. High levels of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were found in all participants. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG and Omicron-specific neutralizing antibodies increased in patients with rebound. Robust SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were observed, higher in rebound compared with early acute COVID-19 patients. Inflammatory markers mostly decreased during rebound. Two patients sampled longitudinally demonstrated an increase in activated cytokine-producing CD4+ T cells against viral proteins. No characteristic resistance mutations were identified. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated by culture from 1 of 8 rebound patients; Polybrene addition increased this to 5 of 8. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment does not impede adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Clinical rebound corresponds to development of a robust antibody and T-cell immune response, arguing against a high risk of disease progression. The presence of infectious virus supports the need for isolation and assessment of longer treatment courses.

Recent case reports document that some patients who were treated with Paxlovid experienced rebound COVID-19 infections and symptoms 2 to 8 days after completing a 5-day course of Paxlovid. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently issued a Health Alert Network Health Advisory to update the public on the potential for COVID-19 rebound after Paxlovid treatments. However, the rates of COVID-19 rebound in a real-world population or whether rebound is unique to Paxlovid remains unknown. To examine the rates and relative risks of COVID-19 rebound in patients treated with Paxlovid or with Molnupiravir and to compare characteristics of patients who experienced COVID-19 rebound to those who did not. Retrospective cohort study of electronic health records (EHRs) of 92 million patients from a multicenter and nationwide database in the US. The study population comprised 13,644 patients age \u2265 18 years who contracted COVID-19 between 1/1/2022-6/8/2022 and were treated with Paxlovid (n =11,270) or with Molnupiravir (n =2,374) within 5 days of their COVID-19 infection. Paxlovid or Molnupiravir. Three types of COVID-19 rebound outcomes (COVID-19 infections, COVID-19 related symptoms, and hospitalizations) were examined. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 7-day and 30-day risk for COVID-19 rebound between patients treated with Paxlovid and patients treated with Molnupiravir were calculated before and after propensity-score matching. The 7-day and 30-day COVID-19 rebound rates after Paxlovid treatment were 3.53% and 5.40% for COVID-19 infection, 2.31% and 5.87% for COVID-19 symptoms, and 0.44% and 0.77% for hospitalizations. The 7-day and 30-day COVID-19 rebound rates after Molnupiravir treatment were 5.86% and 8.59% for COVID-19 infection, 3.75% and 8.21% for COVID-19 symptoms, and 0.84% and 1.39% for hospitalizations. After propensity-score matching, there were no significant differences in COVID-19 rebound risks between Paxlovid and Molnupiravir: infection (HR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.73-1.11), COVID-19 symptoms (HR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.83-1.27), or hospitalizations (HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.56-1.55). Patients with COVID-19 rebound had significantly higher prevalence of underlying medical conditions than those without. COVID-19 rebound occurred both after Paxlovid and Molnupiravir, especially in patients with underlying medical conditions. This indicates that COVID-19 rebound is not unique to Paxlovid and the risks were similar for Paxlovid and Molnupiravir. For both drugs the rates of COVID-19 rebound increased with time after treatments. Our results call for continuous surveillance of COVID-19 rebound after Paxlovid and Molnupiravir treatments. Studies are necessary to determine the mechanisms underlying COVID-19 rebounds and to test dosing and duration regimes that might prevent such rebounds in vulnerable patients.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Recent case reports document that some patients who were treated with Paxlovid experienced rebound COVID-19 infections and symptoms 2 to 8 days after completing a 5-day course of Paxlovid.\", \"The 7-day and 30-day COVID-19 rebound rates after Paxlovid treatment were 3.53% and 5.40% for COVID-19 infection, 2.31% and 5.87% for COVID-19 symptoms, and 0.44% and 0.77% for hospitalizations.\"]}"}]}

Some patients treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir have experienced rebound of COVID-19 infections and symptoms; however, data are scarce on whether viral rebound also occurs in patients with COVID-19 receiving or not receiving molnupiravir. To examine the incidence of viral rebound in patients with COVID-19 who were treated with the oral antiviral agents nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir. This cohort study identified 41\u202f255 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized from January 1, 2022, to March 31, 2022, in Hong Kong and assessed 12\u202f629 patients with serial cycle threshold (Ct) values measured. Patients were followed up until the occurrence of the clinical end point of interest, death, date of data retrieval (July 31, 2022), or up to 30 days of follow-up, whichever came first. Molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment. Viral rebound, defined as a Ct value greater than 40 that decreased to 40 or less. Of 12\u202f629 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.4 [20.9] years; 6624 [52.5%] male), 11\u202f688 (92.5%) were oral antiviral nonusers, 746 (5.9%) were molnupiravir users, and 195 (1.5%) were nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users. Compared with nonusers, oral antiviral users were older, had more comorbidities, and had lower complete vaccination rates. The mean (SD) baseline Ct value was slightly higher in nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users (22.2 [6.0]) than nonusers (21.0 [5.4]) and molnupiravir users (20.9 [5.4]) (P\u2009=\u2009.04). Viral rebound occurred in 68 nonusers (0.6%), 2 nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users (1.0%), and 6 molnupiravir users (0.8%). Among 76 patients with viral rebound, 12 of 68 nonusers, 1 of 6 molnupiravir users, and neither of the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users died of COVID-19. In this cohort study, viral rebound was uncommon in patients taking molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and was not associated with increased risk of mortality. Given these findings, novel oral antivirals should be considered as a treatment for more patients with COVID-19 in the early phase of the infection.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Some patients treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir have experienced rebound of COVID-19 infections and symptoms; however, data are scarce on whether viral rebound also occurs in patients with COVID-19 receiving or not receiving molnupiravir.\"]}"}]}

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The availability of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors has brought about a paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. BTK was clinically validated as a target by the efficacy of the first-in-class inhibitor ibrutinib. The extended survival conferred by BTK inhibitors has brought long-term tolerability to the foreground. To minimize toxicities thought to be attributable to off-target kinase inhibition, a next generation of BTK inhibitors with greater selectivity was developed. In the United States, zanubrutinib, a next-generation BTK inhibitor, has been approved for treating adults with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior therapy, for adults with Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia, and for adults with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma who have received at least one anti-CD20-based therapy. Because few head-to-head comparative trials of BTK inhibitors have so far been reported, no BTK 'inhibitor of choice' can be identified. Zanubrutinib has promising efficacy in its approved indications and appears to have reduced cardiac toxicities, particularly atrial fibrillation, which may influence the choice of BTK inhibitor treatment by prescribers. Further studies are needed to inform on optimal treatment sequencing of zanubrutinib and its combination with other agents. Here, we summarize existing clinical evidence for its efficacy and safety in mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia, marginal zone lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and other B-lymphoproliferative indications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"In the United States, zanubrutinib, a next-generation BTK inhibitor, has been approved for treating adults with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior therapy, for adults with Waldenstr\\u00c3\\u00b6m macroglobulinemia, and for adults with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma who have received at least one anti-CD20-based therapy. \", \"Zanubrutinib is currently approved for use for treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy, for adults with WM, and for adults with MZL who have received at least one anti-CD20-based therapy.\"]}"}]}

In 2020 a prospective study defined the reference intervals of the component of normal pericardial fluid, that was found to be rich in nucleated cells, proteins, albumin and LDH, at levels compatible with the inflammatory exudates of other biological fluids such as pleural or peritoneal fluid; Light's criteria should not be used to evaluate it. Recently we also analyzed systematically large chronic idiopathic non-inflammatory pericardial effusions, observing that a non-invasive wait-and-see approach may be the best choice in clinical practice in oligosymptomatic cases. Concerning acute recurrent pericarditis (RP), an innovative interaction between cardiologists, internists and pediatric rheumatologists led to the intuition of a pivotal role of IL-1 in recurrent pericarditis characterized by an evident inflammatory recurrent phenotype, and recent data have shown the striking efficacy of anakinra and rilonacept in these patients. The proper selection of the patient is important; the ideal candidate for anti-IL-1 therapy is the patient with RP with high levels of serum C-reactive protein, high fever, neutrophil leukocitosis, pleuropulmonary involvement, frequent exacerbations and resistant to conventional therapy. On the contrary, anti-IL-1 drugs are not indicated in patients with pericardial effusion whose cause is not attributable to inflammatory phenomena. Finally, many patients with RP are women of childbearing age, and the possibility for these women to become pregnant must be addressed by multidisciplinary teams.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Concerning acute recurrent pericarditis (RP), an innovative interaction between cardiologists, internists and pediatric rheumatologists led to the intuition of a pivotal role of IL-1 in recurrent pericarditis characterized by an evident inflammatory recurrent phenotype, and recent data have shown the striking efficacy of anakinra and rilonacept in these patients. \"]}"}]}

Pericarditis is a generally benign disease, although complications and/or recurrences may occur in up to 30% of cases. New evidence on the pathophysiology of the disease has accumulated in recent years. Recently, it has been shown that the activation of the NLRP3 (NACHT, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome is central in the pathophysiology of pericarditis. These findings derive from clinical data, an experimental animal model of acute pericarditis supporting a role for the NLRP3 inflammasome in pericarditis, and from indirect evidence of inhibitors of NLRP3 inflammasome in clinical trials. Pericarditis is regarded as a stereotypical response to an acute damage of the mesothelial cells of the pericardial layers. NLRP3 inflammasome, a macromolecular structure sensing damage and releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, is centrally involved as it releases interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, whose auto-induction feeds an autoinflammatory disease, mostly responsible for recurrences. Colchicine, an inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome formation, and IL-1-targeted therapies, such as anakinra and rilonacept, were found to effectively blunt the acute inflammation and reduce the risk for recurrences.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Pericarditis is regarded as a stereotypical response to an acute damage of the mesothelial cells of the pericardial layers.

Recurrent pericarditis (RP) is a complex inflammatory disorder associated with adverse outcomes and poor quality of life. After the first episode of acute pericarditis, a non-negligible group of patients will fail to achieve complete remission despite treatment and will be challenged by side effects from the chronic use of medications like corticosteroids. The cause of RP remains unknown in the majority of cases, mainly due to a gap in knowledge of its complex pathophysiology. Over the past 2 decades, the interleukin-1 (IL-1) pathway has been uncovered as a key element in the inflammatory cascade, allowing the development of pharmacological targets known as IL-1 inhibitors. This group of medications has emerged as a treatment option for patients with RP colchicine-resistance and steroid dependents. Currently, anakinra and rilonacept, have demonstrated beneficial impact in clinical outcomes with a reasonable safety profile in randomized clinical trials. There is still paucity of data regarding the use of canakinumab in the treatment of patients with RP. Although further studies are needed to refine therapeutic protocols and taper of concomitant therapies, IL-1 inhibitors, continue to consolidate as part of the pharmacological armamentarium to manage this complex condition with potential use as monotherapy. The aim of this review is to highlight the role of IL-1 pathway in RP and discuss the efficacy, safety, and clinical applicability of IL-1 inhibitors in the treatment of RP based on current evidence.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Currently, anakinra and rilonacept, have demonstrated beneficial impact in clinical outcomes with a reasonable safety profile in randomized clinical trials.

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of rilonacept for the prevention and treatment of recurrent pericarditis (RP). A MEDLINE search was conducted between January 2006 and April 2021 using the following terms: rilonacept, pharmacology, pericarditis, recurrent pericarditis, interleukin (IL) antagonist, and pharmacology; prescribing information was also used. English-language studies assessing pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of IL antagonists were reviewed. Rilonacept traps IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. In the Phase III trial, rilonacept was associated with a lower risk of recurrence, more persistent clinical response, and higher amount of days with no or minimal pericarditis symptoms, compared with placebo. The median time to pain response was 5 days, and median time to normalization of C-reactive protein was 7 days with rilonacept. All patients receiving rilonacept during the run-in period were able to be weaned off of standard background therapy, leading to transition to rilonacept monotherapy. The most common adverse effects were upper respiratory tract infections and injection site reactions.

Anti-interleukin (IL)-1 agents have been developed for the treatment of autoinflammatory and rheumatic conditions, where overproduction of IL-1 is an important pathophysiologic process. IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are the most studied members of the IL-1 family of cytokines and have the strongest proinflammatory effects. A naturally occurring antagonist (IL-1Ra) mitigates their proinflammatory effects. Overproduction of both IL-1\u03b1 (released by inflamed/damaged pericardial cells) and IL-1\u03b2 (released by inflammatory cells) is now a well-recognized therapeutic target in patients with recurrent idiopathic pericarditis. Currently, there are three available anti-IL-1 agents: anakinra (recombinant human IL-1Ra), rilonacept (a soluble decoy receptor 'trap', binding both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2), and canakinumab (human monoclonal anti-IL-1\u03b2 antibody). For patients with corticosteroid-dependent and colchicine-resistant recurrent pericarditis with evidence of systemic inflammation, as evidenced by elevated C-reactive protein, the efficacy and safety of anakinra (2\u2009mg/kg/day up to 100\u2009mg/day subcutaneously usually for at least 6\u2009months, then tapered) and rilonacept (320\u2009mg subcutaneously for the first day followed by 160\u2009mg subcutaneously weekly) have been clearly demonstrated in observational studies and randomized controlled clinical trials. Severe side effects are rare and discontinuation rates are very low (<4%). The most common reported side effect is injection site reactions (>50% of patients). In this article, we describe the historical and pathophysiological background and provide a comprehensive review of these agents, which appear to be the most significant advance in medical therapy of recurrent pericarditis in the last 5\u2009years.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Overproduction of both IL-1\\u00ce\\u00b1 (released by inflamed/damaged pericardial cells) and IL-1\\u00ce\\u00b2 (released by inflammatory cells) is now a well-recognized therapeutic target in patients with recurrent idiopathic pericarditis.

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Lower grade gliomas (LGGs) with codeletion of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q (1p/19 codeletion) have a favorable outcome. However, its overall survival (OS) varies. Here, we established an immune signature associated with 1p/19q codeletion for accurate prediction of prognosis of LGGs. The Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases with RNA sequencing and corresponding clinical data were dichotomized into training group and testing group. The immune-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with 1p/19q codeletion were screened using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. A prognostic signature was established using dataset from CGGA and tested in TCGA database. Subsequently, we explored the correlation between the prognostic signature and immune response. Thirteen immune genes associated with 1p/19q codeletion were used to construct a prognostic signature. The 1-, 3-, 5-year survival rates of the low-risk group were approximately 97%, 89%, and 79%, while those of the high-risk group were 81%, 50% and 34%, respectively, in the training group. The nomogram which comprised age, WHO grade, primary or recurrent types, 1p/19q codeletion status and risk score provided accurate prediction for the survival rate of glioma. DEGs that were highly expressed in the high-risk group clustered with many immune-related pathways. Immune checkpoints including TIM3, PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, TIGIT, MIR155HG, and CD48 were correlated with the risk score.

The revised 4th edition of the 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (2016 CNS WHO) has introduced the integrated diagnostic classification that combines molecular and histological diagnoses for diffuse gliomas. In this study, we evaluated the molecular alterations for consecutive 300 diffuse glioma cases (grade 2, 56; grade 3, 62; grade 4, 182) based on this classification. Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes were common in lower grade glioma (LGG: grade2-3), and when combined with 1p/19q status, LGGs could be stratified into three groups except for four cases (Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant: 44; Oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and 1p/19q codeleted: 37; Astrocytoma, IDH-wildtype: 33). 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas were clinically the most favorable subgroup even with upfront chemotherapy. In contrast, IDH-wildtype astrocytomas had a relatively worse prognosis; however, this subgroup was more heterogeneous. Of this subgroup, 11 cases had TERT promoter (pTERT) mutation with shorter overall survival than 12 pTERT-wildtype cases. Additionally, a longitudinal analysis indicated pTERT mutation as early molecular event for gliomagenesis. Therefore, pTERT mutation is critical for the diagnosis of molecular glioblastoma (WHO grade 4), regardless of histological findings, and future treatment strategy should be considered based on the precise molecular analysis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"diffuse glioma cases (grade 2, 56; grade 3, 62; grade 4, 182) based on this classification.

The presence of chromosome 1p/19q co-deletion is one of the hallmark required criteria for the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma, using the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System. Descriptions in the literature of astrocytomas, primarily glioblastomas, demonstrating partial losses on one or the other chromosome have been described. The significance of these small deletions is uncertain. Only rarely have cases of fibrillary astrocytoma been described as having co-deletion, which may potentially cause diagnostic confusion with oligodendroglioma. The goal of this study is to examine a large number of fibrillary astrocytomas to document how often 1p/19q co-deletions are present by Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) testing (the testing method of choice in many institutions) and to evaluate what other markers may be helpful in avoiding misdiagnosis. This study is a retrospective evaluation of 359 fibrillary astrocytomas (55 grade II, 62 grade III and 242 grade IV) encountered between June 2016 and June 2019, we identified 11 tumors (3.1%) that had 1p/19q co-deletion by FISH testing. The clinical and pathologic features of these cases were reviewed. The 11 cases with co-deletion included 5 females who ranged in age from 37 to 86\u00a0years (median 63\u00a0years). Tumors arose in the temporal lobe in 5 patients, frontal lobe in 2, parietal lobe in 2, occipital lobe in 1, and cerebellum in 1. Final diagnoses included glioblastoma in 8 patients, anaplastic astrocytoma in 2, and diffuse astrocytoma in 1. Only 1 case (anaplastic astrocytoma) demonstrated evidence of IDH-1 immunoreactivity; none of the other 10 tumors showed evidence of an IDH1/2 mutation by PCR testing. Four tumors demonstrated p53 immunostaining of 30% or more. ATRX mutation as evidenced by loss of staining was observed in only 2 cases. Evidence of EGFR amplification by FISH testing was noted in 5 cases. Of particular note in the one case that demonstrated both 1p/19q co-deletion and an IDH-1 mutation, LOH testing was done and showed only partial losses on both chromosomes. Additionally, this tumor also demonstrated evidence of ATRX and p53 mutations by immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, co-deletions were noted in a minority of astrocytomas (3.1% of cases in the current study). Only 1 of 11 of these cases also demonstrated evidence of an IDH mutation, potentially raising differential diagnostic confusion with oligodendroglioma.

Oligodendroglial tumours (OT) are a heterogeneous group of gliomas. Three molecular subgroups are currently distinguished on the basis of the IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion. Here we present an integrated analysis of the transcriptome, genome and methylome of 156 OT. Not only does our multi-omics classification match the current classification but also reveals three subgroups within 1p/19q co-deleted tumours, associated with specific expression patterns of nervous system cell types: oligodendrocyte, oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) and neuronal lineage. We confirm the validity of these three subgroups using public datasets. Importantly, the OPC-like group is associated with more aggressive clinical and molecular patterns, including MYC activation. We show that the MYC activation occurs through various alterations, including MYC genomic gain, MAX genomic loss, MYC hypomethylation and microRNA-34b/c down-regulation. In the lower grade glioma TCGA dataset, the OPC-like group is associated with a poorer outcome independently of histological grade. Our study reveals previously unrecognized heterogeneity among 1p/19q co-deleted tumours. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Oligodendroglial tumours (OT) are a heterogeneous group of gliomas.

The classification of central nervous system tumours has more recently been shaped by a focus on molecular pathology rather than histopathology. We re-classified 82 glial tumours according to the molecular-genetic criteria of the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System. Initial diagnoses and grading were based on the morphological criteria of the 2007 WHO scheme. Because of the impression of an oligodendroglial component on initial histological assessment, each tumour was tested for co-deletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q and mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH-1 and 2) genes. Additionally, expression of proteins encoded by alpha-thalassemia X-linked mental retardation (ATRX) and TP53 genes was assessed by immunohistochemistry. We found that all but two tumours could be assigned to a specific category in the 2016 revision. The most common change in diagnosis was from oligoastrocytoma to specifically astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma. Analysis of progression free survival (PFS) for WHO grade II and III tumours showed that the objective criteria of the 2016 revision separated diffuse gliomas into three distinct molecular categories: chromosome 1p/19q co-deleted/IDH mutant, intact 1p/19q/IDH mutant and IDH wild type. No significant difference in PFS was found when comparing IDH mutant grade II and III tumours suggesting that IDH status is more informative than tumour grade. The segregation into distinct molecular sub-types that is achieved by the 2016 revision provides an objective evidence base for managing patients with grade II and III diffuse gliomas based on prognosis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"diffuse gliomas into three distinct molecular categories: chromosome 1p/19q co-deleted/IDH mutant, intact 1p/19q/IDH mutant and IDH wild type.\"]}"}]}

The publication of the 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (2016 WHO CNS) represented a major change in the classification of brain tumors. It is essential to determine the IDH and 1p/19q statuses of diffuse gliomas to ensure that the final diagnosis is accurate. The integrated diagnostic method outlined in the 2016 WHO CNS has enabled more precise prediction of the prognoses of diffuse gliomas. However, there are further two points that need to be addressed when planning future clinical trials. The first is the problems with the WHO grading system for diffuse gliomas. The second is that examinations for IDH mutations and 1p/19q co-deletion are not sufficient on their own to accurately predict the prognosis of diffuse glioma patients. Risk of an IDH-mut diffuse glioma should be evaluated based on a combination of clinical factors (age and the resection rate), molecular factors (the presence/absence of CDKN2A deletion), and histological factors (morphology and the mitotic index). Glioblastoma (GBM) have also been classified according to their IDH status; however, the frequency of IDH gene mutations is only 5-10% in GBM. Other molecular markers such as MGMT methylation, pTERT mutations and EGFR amplification could be more important to predict clinical outcome. Therefore, the next revision of the classification of diffuse gliomas will propose a detailed classification based on additional markers. In the near future, treatments for diffuse gliomas will be chosen according to the molecular profile of each tumor.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The second is that examinations for IDH mutations and 1p/19q co-deletion are not sufficient on their own to accurately predict the prognosis of diffuse glioma patients.\"]}"}]}

Co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q, characteristic of oligodendroglial tumors, was recently found to be mediated by t(1;19)(q10;p10). To evaluate the prevalence of 1p19q co-deletion and t(1;19) in extraventricular neurocytomas (EVN), we studied tumors from 23 patients, including 13 females and 10 males (median age at diagnosis 34 years, range 2-76 years). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies were performed with probes targeting 1p36/1q25 and 19q13/19p13 to assess for 1p19q co-deletion, as well as chromosome 1 alpha-satellite and 19p12 to detect t(1;19)(q10;p10). FISH was successful in 21 (91%) cases and demonstrated 1p19q co-deletion in five cases (24%) or isolated 1p loss in two cases (10%). Evidence for t(1;19) was found in four (of five) cases with 1p19q co-deletion. Three tumors with 1p19q loss and t(1;19) demonstrated atypical histologic features, compared with one (of 17) tumors without 1p19q co-deletion (P = 0.01, Fisher exact test).

Co-deletion of 1p and 19q marks a diffuse glioma subtype associated with relatively favorable overall survival; however, heterogeneous clinical outcomes are observed within this category. We assembled gene expression profiles and sample annotation of 374 glioma patients carrying the 1p/19q co-deletion. We predicted 1p/19q status using gene expression when annotation was missing. A first cohort was randomly split into training (n = 170) and a validation dataset (n = 163). A second validation set consisted of 41 expression profiles. An elastic-net penalized Cox proportional hazards model was applied to build a classifier model through cross-validation within the training dataset. The selected 35-gene signature was used to identify high-risk and low-risk groups in the validation set, which showed significantly different overall survival (P = .00058, log-rank test). For time-to-death events, the high-risk group predicted by the gene signature yielded a hazard ratio of 1.78 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-3.11). The signature was also significantly associated with clinical outcome in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (CGA) IDH-mutant 1p/19q wild-type and IDH-wild-type glioma cohorts. Pathway analysis suggested that high risk was associated with increased acetylation activity and inflammatory response. Tumor purity was found to be significantly decreased in high-risk IDH-mutant with 1p/19q co-deletion gliomas and IDH-wild-type glioblastomas but not in IDH-wild-type lower grade or IDH-mutant, non-co-deleted gliomas. We identified a 35-gene signature that identifies high-risk and low-risk categories of 1p/19q positive glioma patients.

It is an established predictive and prognostic biomarker that informs whether patients are offered radiotherapy, chemotherapy or both. In the near future, 1p19q co-deletion status may also be incorporated into the reclassification of gliomas. Analysis is commonly carried out using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) because it is a reliable and validated laboratory technique. The result is generally considered to be dichotomous (1p19q co-deletion present or absent), but there are subtleties in interpretation that are of clinical relevance. Separate centres may interpret certain chromosome deletion patterns differently. Pivotal trials in mixed and pure anaplastic oligodendrogliomas have used slightly different FISH probe ratios as the cut-off for chromosome deletion. Here we review the clinical implications of this variability and review the process of 1p19q co-deletion assessment using FISH in gliomas from a clinician's perspective. We also consider common alternative methods of analysis. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"1p19q co-deletion is a chromosomal alteration associated with primary brain tumours of oligodendroglial histology.\"]}"}]}

The IDH-mutant and 1p/19q co-deletion (1p19q codel) provides significant diagnostic and prognostic value in lower-grade gliomas. As ATRX mutation and 1p19q codel are mutually exclusive, ATRX immunohistochemistry (IHC) may substitute for 1p19q codel, but this has not been comprehensively examined. In the current study, we performed ATRX-IHC in 78 gliomas whose ATRX statuses were comprehensively determined by whole exome sequencing. Among the 60 IHC-positive and 18 IHC-negative cases, 86.7 and 77.8% were ATRX-wildtype and ATRX-mutant, respectively. ATRX mutational patterns were not consistent with ATRX-IHC. If our cohort had only used IDH status and IHC-based ATRX expression for diagnosis, 78 tumors would have been subtyped as 48 oligodendroglial tumors, 16 IDH-mutant astrocytic tumors, and 14 IDH-wildtype astrocytic tumors. However, when the 1p19q codel test was performed following ATRX-IHC, 8 of 48 ATRX-IHC-positive tumors were classified as \"1p19q non-codel\" and 3 of 16 ATRX-IHC-negative tumors were classified as \"1p19q codel\"; a total of 11 tumors (14%) were incorrectly classified. In summary, we observed dissociation between ATRX-IHC and actual 1p19q codel in 11 of 64 IDH-mutant LGGs.

The majority of oligodendrogliomas (ODGs) exhibit combined losses of chromosomes 1p and 19q and mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1-R132H or IDH2-R172K). Approximately 70% of ODGs with 1p19q co-deletions harbor somatic mutations in the Capicua Transcriptional Repressor (CIC) gene on chromosome 19q13.2.

Cytoplasmic CIC-S is found in close proximity to the mitochondria. To study wild type and mutant CIC function and motivated by the paucity of 1p19q co-deleted ODG lines, we created HEK293 and HOG stable cell lines ectopically co-expressing CIC and IDH1. Non-mutant lines displayed increased clonogenicity, but cells co-expressing the mutant IDH1-R132H with either CIC-S-R201W or -R1515H showed reduced clonogenicity in an additive manner, demonstrating cooperative effects in our assays.

Oligodendroglioma represents a distinctive neoplasm in adults but similar neoplasms occur rarely in children. We studied 20 cases of pediatric oligodendroglioma by SNP array (median age 9 years, range 1-19; 15 grade II and 5 grade III). Cytogenetic abnormalities were present in 8 (53%) grade II and all five anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Most changes were in the form of deletion and copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH). The most common abnormality was 1p deletion (n\u2009=\u20095). Whole arm 1p19q co-deletion was present in three cases from adolescent patients and 9p loss in 3, including one low-grade oligodendroglioma with CDKN2A homozygous deletion.

Oligodendrogliomas (ODs) are the second most common malignant brain tumor and exhibit characteristic co-deletion of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q (co-deletion 1p/19q), which is associated with down-regulation of tumor suppressors. However, co-deletion 1p/19q indicates a favorable prognosis that cannot be explained by the down-regulation of tumor suppressors. In the present study, we determined that co-deletion 1p/19q was associated with reduced Ki-67 protein level based on analysis of 354 ODs. To identify genes associated with reduced Ki-67 and a favorable prognosis of codeletion 1p/19q, we analyzed 96 ODs with RNA-sequencing and 136 ODs and 4 normal brain tissue samples with RNA microarrays. We thus identified seven genes within chromosomal arms 1p/19q with significantly reduced expression in samples with co-deletion of 1p/19q compared to samples with intact 1p/19q. A significant positive correlation was observed between these candidate genes and Ki-67 expression based on analysis of mRNA expression in 305 gliomas and 5 normal brain tissue samples.

Oligodendrogliomas are primary human brain tumors with a characteristic 1p/19q co-deletion of important prognostic relevance, but little is known about the pathology of this chromosomal mutation. We developed a network-based approach to identify novel cancer gene candidates in the region of the 1p/19q co-deletion. Gene regulatory networks were learned from gene expression and copy number data of 178 oligodendrogliomas and further used to quantify putative impacts of differentially expressed genes of the 1p/19q region on cancer-relevant pathways. We predicted 8 genes with strong impact on signaling pathways and 14 genes with strong impact on metabolic pathways widespread across the region of the 1p/19 co-deletion. Many of these candidates (e.g. ELTD1, SDHB, SEPW1, SLC17A7, SZRD1, THAP3, ZBTB17) are likely to push, whereas others (e.g. CAP1, HBXIP, KLK6, PARK7, PTAFR) might counteract oligodendroglioma development. For example, ELTD1, a functionally validated glioblastoma oncogene located on 1p, was overexpressed. Further, the known glioblastoma tumor suppressor SLC17A7 located on 19q was underexpressed. Moreover, known epigenetic alterations triggered by mutated SDHB in paragangliomas suggest that underexpressed SDHB in oligodendrogliomas may support and possibly enhance the epigenetic reprogramming induced by the IDH-mutation. We further analyzed rarely observed deletions and duplications of chromosomal arms within oligodendroglioma subcohorts identifying putative oncogenes and tumor suppressors that possibly influence the development of oligodendroglioma subgroups. Our in-depth computational study contributes to a better understanding of the pathology of the 1p/19q co-deletion and other chromosomal arm mutations. This might open opportunities for functional validations and new therapeutic strategies.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Oligodendrogliomas are primary human brain tumors with a characteristic 1p/19q co-deletion of important prognostic relevance, but little is known about the pathology of this chromosomal mutation.\"]}"}]}

It has been reported recently that oligodendroglial tumors arising in the insula rarely harbor co-deletions of chromosomes 1p and 19q, a molecular signature which is associated with a good prognosis and increased responsiveness to radiation and chemotherapy compared with tumors in which 1p and/or 19q is intact. In the context of this claim, we analyzed a series of insular oligodendroglial tumors in order to determine the frequency of 1p/19q co-deletion in tumors arising in this region. We identified 14 insular cases operated on after 2003 in which testing for losses of 1p and 19q was performed. Of these cases, co-deletion of 1p and 19q occurred in eight (57%). Four (50%) of eight oligodendrogliomas and four (67%) of six oligoastrocytomas demonstrated 1p/19q co-deletions. Seven of the eight tumors with co-deletion of 1p/19q were WHO grade II gliomas. There were no statistical differences between tumors with 1p/19q co-deletion compared to those with 1p and/or 19q intact in terms of age, preoperative KPS, presenting symptoms, left versus right lateralization, tumor location (purely insular versus extension into frontal or temporal lobe), preoperative tumor size. There was a preponderance of females in the co-deletion group, and a greater average extent of resection. In contradistinction to previous reports, loss of 1p/19q occurs commonly in insular oligodendroglial tumors.

Here, we aimed to explore the clinical implications of 1p19q gene expression in 1p/19q non-codel gliomas. We analyzed expression of 1p19q genes in 668 1p/19q non-codel gliomas obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 447) and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (n = 221) for training and validation, respectively. The expression of 1p19q genes was significantly correlated with the clinicopathological features and overall survival of 1p/19q non-codel gliomas. Then, we derived a risk signature of 25 selected 1p19q genes that not only had prognosis value in total 1p/19q non-codel gliomas but also had prognosis value in stratified gliomas. The prognosis value of the risk signature was superior than known clinicopathological features in 1p/19q non-codel gliomas and was also highly associated with the following features: loss of CDKN2A/B copy number in mutant-IDH-astrocytoma; telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutation, combined chromosome 7 gain/chromosome 10 loss and epidermal growth factor receptor amplification in wild-type-IDH-astrocytoma; classical and mesenchymal subtypes in glioblastoma. Furthermore, genes enriched in the biological processes of cell division, extracellular matrix, angiogenesis significantly correlated to the signature risk score, and this is also supported by the immunohistochemistry and cell biology experiments. In conclusion, the expression profile of 1p19q genes is highly associated with the malignancy and prognosis of 1p/19q non-codel gliomas.

Glial tumors are malignant brain tumors that arise from glial cells of brain or spine and have genetic aberrations in their genome. 1p/19q co-deletion is associated with increased Overall Survival (OS) time with enhanced response to chemo- and radio-therapy in oligodendrogliomas. However, prognostic significance of 1p/19q co-polysomy is still unclear. We evaluated 1p/19q status of 221 patients with glial tumor by Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH). Records of the patients were collected retrospectively. Our results demonstrated that 1p/19q co-polysomy was associated with decreased OS time, high P53 expression and frequently located in temporal lobe, whereas 1p/19q co-deletion was associated with increased overall survival time, low P53 expression and frontal lobe location. Furthermore, classification of patients based on both 1p/19q status and P53 expression revealed that patients with 1p/19q co-polysomy and high P53 expression had the worst prognosis. Lastly, our bioinformatic survival analysis revealed that high expression of SRM, ICMT, and FTL located in 1p36.13-p36.31 and 19q13.2-q13.33 region were related with decreased OS time in patients with Low Grade Glioma (LGG).

Molecular testing is increasingly important in cancer diagnosis. Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) is widely accepted method but structural variation (SV) detection by targeted NGS remains challenging. In the brain tumor, identification of molecular alterations, including 1p/19q co-deletion, is essential for accurate glial tumor classification. Hence, we used targeted NGS to detect 1p/19q co-deletion using a newly developed deep learning (DL) model in 61 tumors, including 19 oligodendroglial tumors. An ensemble 1-dimentional convolution neural network was developed and used to detect the 1p/19q co-deletion. External validation was performed using 427 low-grade glial tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Manual review of the copy number plot from the targeted NGS identified the 1p/19q co-deletion in all 19 oligodendroglial tumors. Our DL model also perfectly detected the 1p/19q co-deletion (area under the curve, AUC\u2009=\u20091) in the testing set, and yielded reproducible results (AUC\u2009=\u20090.9652) in the validation set (n\u2009=\u2009427), although the validation data were generated on a completely different platform (SNP Array 6.0 platform).

Anaplastic oligodendrogliomas are high-grade gliomas defined molecularly by 1p19q co-deletion. There is no curative therapy, and standard of care includes surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy. However, the benefit of up-front radiation with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone has not been demonstrated in a randomized control trial. Given the potential long-term consequences of radiation therapy, such as cognitive impairment, arteriopathy, endocrinopathy, and hearing/visual impairment, there is an effort to balance longevity with radiation toxicity. We performed a retrospective single institution analysis of survival of patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma over 20 years. 159 patients were identified as diagnosed with an anaplastic oligodendroglioma between 1996 and 2016. Of those, 40 patients were found to have AO at original diagnosis and had documented 1p19q co-deletion with a median of 7.1 years of follow-up (range: 0.6-16.7 years). After surgery, 45\u2009% of patients were treated with radiation and chemotherapy at diagnosis, and 50\u2009% were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy alone. The group treated with chemotherapy alone had a trend of receiving more cycles of chemotherapy than patients treated with radiation and chemotherapy upfront (p\u2009=\u20090.051). Median overall survival has not yet been reached. The related risk of progression in the upfront, adjuvant chemotherapy only group was almost 5-fold higher than the patients who received radiation and chemotherapy (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20094.85 (1.74-13.49), p\u2009=\u20090.002). However, there was no significant difference in overall survival in patients treated with upfront chemotherapy compared to patients treated upfront with chemotherapy and radiation (p\u2009=\u20090.8). Univariate analysis of age, KPS, extent of resection, or upfront versus delayed radiation was not associated with improved survival. Initial treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy alone, rather than radiation and chemotherapy, may be an option for some patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma, as it is associated with similar overall survival despite shorter progression free survival.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"INTRODUCTION: Anaplastic oligodendrogliomas are high-grade gliomas defined molecularly by 1p19q co-deletion\"]}"}]}

The optimal treatment strategy for anaplastic oligodendroglial (AO) tumors is evolving. Molecular profiling of oligodendrogliomas have shown distinctive genetic patterns characterized by combined deletions of chromosome arms 1p and 19q, O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations; they are all prognostic factors for patients with AO. In addition, a strong association has also been found between the CpG island hypermethylation phenotype (CIMP) status and MGMT promoter methylation. Long term follow up data of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9402 and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 26951 studies demonstrate clear evidence that for patients with codeleted 1p19q AO, early chemotherapy with radiation offers a significant improvement in overall survival compared with early radiation, even with salvage chemotherapy at tumor relapse, and thus establishes the 1p19q allelic loss as a predictive marker distinct from tumors without the chromosome change. Radiotherapy alone is no longer considered an adequate treatment for this patient population. In cases with no 1p19q deletion, most neuro-oncologists recommend incorporating radiotherapy into the upfront treatment strategy. However, there are still unanswered questions regarding whether upfront chemotherapy, omitting/deferring radiotherapy, in the desire to avoid late neurocognitive toxicity of radiotherapy should be the initial therapy for AO tumors with codeleted 1p19q, or whether temozolomide, an oral agent with a better toxicity profile, can be substituted for procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV).

As a result, a broader view of the genomic landscape of solid tumors may be explored. Whole genome copy number and loss of heterozygosity patterns can advance our understanding of mechanisms and complexity of various tumors. Genome-wide alterations involving copy number changes and loss of heterozygosity were identified in 17 glioma samples with positive FISH results for 1p19q co-deletions (n\u2009=\u20099) or EGFR amplification (n\u2009=\u20098). Gliomas positive for 1p19q co-deletions did not have other frequently recurrent genomic alterations.

The genomic architecture of EGFR amplified gliomas was much more complex, with a high number of gains and losses across the genome. Recurrent alterations in EGFR amplified gliomas were both focal, such as CDKN2A homozygous deletions, and large, such as chromosome 10 loss. Microarray enabled a broader picture of the genomic alterations occurring in glioma cases. Gliomas with 1p19q co-deletion had a relatively quiet genome, apart from the selected co-deletion. Additional alterations in isolated cases, involved primarily larger aberrations. On the other hand, EGFR amplified cases tended to be more complex and have specific abnormalities associated with the EGFR amplification.

Losses of chromosomes 1p and 19q are deemed correlated with diagnosis of oligodendroglioma, higher chemosensitivity and better prognosis. We reviewed the literature to evaluate the usefulness of these correlations in daily clinical practice. The rates of deletions relative to histology (WHO classifications) were extracted from 33 studies, including 2666 patients. The 1p deletions and 1p19q codeletion mean rates were respectively 65.4 and 63.3% in oligodendrogliomas, 28.7 and 21.6% in oligoastrocytomas, 13.2 and 7.5% in astrocytomas, 11.6 and 2.9% in glioblastomas. The presence of 1p deletion and 1p19q codeletion were strongly correlated with the histological diagnosis corresponding to oligodendroglioma. Calculation of specificity, sensitivity, predictive positive values and false negative rates suggests that presence of deletion 1p or codeletion represents a strong argument in favor of the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma. However, considering the high false negative rate, absence of such deletions does not rule out the diagnosis. In grade 3 oligodendroglial tumors, the probability of responding to chemotherapy, and the duration of response, were higher when codeletions were present. This suggests that, in these tumors, the presence of codeletion is a strong argument in favor of adjuvant chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy should not be systematically excluded when codeletions are absent, as the chances of response are about 33% in this situation. Data concerning low-grade gliomas were more controversial. Oligodendroglial tumors with 1p deletion or 1p19q codeletion seemed to have a better prognosis, as five-year survival rates were 50% higher than in tumors without deletion. This might be explained by the correlation between 1p deletion and other identified prognosis factors: (1) higher chemosensitivity, (2) tumor location more frequently in the frontal lobe, leading to better resection and lower risk of neurological deficit, (3) slower growth rate, (4) higher risk of epilepsy, leading to an early detection.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"uation.

Therefore, we propose an automatic segmentation and classification pipeline based on routinely acquired pre-operative MRI (T1, T1 postcontrast, T2 and/or FLAIR). A 3D U-Net was designed for segmentation and trained on the BraTS 2019 training dataset. After segmentation, the 3D tumor region of interest is extracted from the MRI and fed into a CNN to simultaneously predict grade, IDH mutation and 1p19q co-deletion. Multi-task learning allowed to handle missing labels and train one network on a large dataset of 628 patients, collected from The Cancer Imaging Archive and BraTS databases. Additionally, the network was validated on an independent dataset of 110 patients retrospectively acquired at the Ghent University Hospital (GUH). Segmentation performance calculated on the BraTS validation set shows an average whole tumor dice score of 90% and increased robustness to missing image modalities by randomly excluding input MRI during training. Classification area under the curve scores are 93%, 94% and 82% on the TCIA test data and 94%, 86% and 87% on the GUH data for grade, IDH and 1p19q status respectively. We developed a fast, automatic pipeline to segment glioma and accurately predict important (molecular) markers based on pre-therapy MRI.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"In the WHO glioma classification guidelines grade (glioblastoma versus lower-grade glioma), IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion status play a central role as they are important markers for prognosis and optimal therapy planning.\"]}"}]}

The purpose of the present study was to investigate potential prognostic factors in low-grade oligodendrogliomas (LGOs), particularly 1p19q deletion, due to its proven prognostic significance in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. We carried out a retrospective review of patients with a histological diagnosis of LGO between 1990 and 2000 in Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand. All cases underwent central histopathological review and FISH testing for 1p19q status. Univariate analysis of potential prognostic factors including 1p19q status, age, tumour size, tumour crossing midline, tumour enhancement, extent of surgery and seizures at diagnosis was carried out. Thirty-one patients were eligible and FISH testing was successful in 28 specimens (90%). Twenty-three specimens (82%) had 1p19q deletion; four (14%) had no 1p19q deletion; and one (4%) had 1p deletion alone. At a median follow-up of 87 months (0-147 months), median survival had not been reached and no significant difference in overall survival (OS) based on 1p19q status was detected (1p19q deletion OS 56%; 1p19q intact OS 0%; 1p deletion alone 100% (P = 0.38)). None of the other prognostic factors investigated reached statistical significance. We confirmed the high incidence (82%) of combined 1p19q deletion in LGOs and the feasibility of successful FISH testing in paraffin embedded specimens up to 10-years-old. Analysis of potential prognostic factors was limited by the lack of events during the follow-up period.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"We confirmed the high incidence (82%) of combined 1p19q deletion in LGOs and the feasibility of successful FISH testing in paraffin embedded specimens up to 10-years-old.\", \"etrospective review of prognostic factors, including 1p19q deletion, in low-grade oligodendrogliomas and a review of recent published works\"]}"}]}

Oligodendrocyte transcriptional factor-2 (Olig2) is an essential marker for oligodendrocytes expression. We aimed to explore the expression of Olig2 in different glial neoplasms and to investigate if diffuse Olig2 expression can replace 1p19q co-deletion for the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma. Olig2 was performed on 53 samples of different glial neoplasms using immunohistochemistry (IHC). 1p/19q deletions were investigated using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Olig2 labelling of different glial neoplasms revealed various expressions, in which 26 tumours showed diffuse expression (\u2265 60%) and 23 tumours showed partial focal expression (< 50%). Four tumours showed no expression. Of the 26 tumours, 6 oligodendrogliomas had 1p19q co-deletion and the remaining 3 oligodendrogliomas showed no co-deletion. Three non-oligodendroglial tumours were found to have 19q deletion. The FISH of the remaining tumours (14/26) showed no aberrations. There was no significant difference in the final diagnosis by using 1p19q co-deletion test among glial neoplasms with diffuse Olig2 expression (p = 0.248). Olig2 marker cannot be used as an alternative diagnostic method for 1p19q co-deletion to distinguish oligodendrogliomas from other glial neoplasms.

Oligodendroglial tumors (OTs) are primary brain tumors that show variable clinical and biological behavior. The 1p/19q codeletion is frequent in these tumors, indicating a better prognosis and/or treatment response. Recently, the prognostically favorable CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in gliomas (G-CIMP+) was associated with mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH) genes, as opposed to G-CIMP- tumors, highlighting the relevance of epigenetic mechanisms. We performed a whole-genome methylation study in 46 OTs, and a gene expression study of 25 tumors, correlating the methylation and transcriptomic profiles with molecular and clinical variables. Here, we identified two different epigenetic patterns within the previously described main G-CIMP+ profile. Both IDH mutation-associated methylation profiles featured one group of OTs with 1p/19q loss (CD-CIMP+), most of which were pure oligodendrogliomas, and a second group with intact 1p/19q and frequent TP53 mutation (CIMP+), most of which exhibited a mixed histopathology. A third group of OTs lacking the CIMP profile (CIMP-), and with a wild-type IDH and an intact 1p/19q, similar to the G-CIMP- subgroup, was also observed. The three CIMP groups presented a significantly better (CD-CIMP+), intermediate (CIMP+) or worse (CIMP-) prognosis. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses revealed CIMP-specific gene expression signatures, indicating the impact of genetic status (IDH mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, TP53 mutation) on gene expression, and pointing to candidate biomarkers. Therefore, the CIMP profiles contributed to the identification of subgroups of OTs characterized by different prognoses, histopathologies, molecular features and gene expression signatures, which may help in the classification of OTs. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Oligodendroglial tumors (OTs) are primary brain tumors that show variable clinical and biological behavior.

Anaplastic gliomas represent a heterogeneous group of primary high-grade brain tumors, and the optimal postoperative treatment remains controversial. In this report, we present our institutional data on the clinical outcomes of radiation therapy (RT) plus temozolomide (RT + TMZ) for anaplastic gliomas, stratified by histology and 1p/19q codeletion. A single-institution retrospective review was conducted of patients with supratentorial anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), mixed anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (AOA), and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA). After surgery, RT was delivered at a median total dose of 60 Gy (range, 31.6-63 Gy) in daily fractions. All patients received standard concurrent TMZ, with or without adjuvant TMZ. Histological/molecular subtypes were defined as codeleted AO/AOA, non-codeleted AO/AOA, and AA. From 2000 to 2012, 111 cases met study criteria and were evaluable. Codeleted AO/AOA had superior overall survival (OS) to non-codeleted AO/AOA (91% vs 68% at 5 years, respectively, P=.02), whereas progression-free survival (PFS) was not significantly different (70% vs 46% at 5 years, respectively, P=.10). AA had inferior OS to non-codeleted AO/AOA (37% vs 68% at 5 years, respectively, P=.007) and inferior PFS (27% vs 46%, respectively, P=.03). On multivariate analysis, age, performance status, and histological or molecular subtype were independent predictors for both PFS and OS. Compared to historical controls, RT + TMZ provided comparable OS to RT with procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (RT + PCV) for codeleted AO/AOA, superior OS to RT alone for non-codeleted AO/AOA, and similar OS to RT alone for AA. RT + TMZ may be a promising treatment for both codeleted and non-codeleted AO/AOA, but its role for AA remains unclear.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"PURPOSE: Anaplastic gliomas represent a heterogeneous group of primary high-grade brain tumors, and the optimal postoperative treatment remains controversial.

IDH1/2 mutations and 1p/19q codeletion occur frequently in anaplastic gliomas and are prognostic factors. We combined these two biomarkers to stratify patients treated for anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO). 43 consecutive WHO AO were selected. We combined immunohistochemistry (IHC) with the monoclonal antibody mIDH1R132H and DNA sequencing of IDH1 and IDH2 genes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was carried out to evaluate 1p/19q codeletion. These biomarkers were correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). IDH1/IDH2 mutations occurred in 23/43 (54 %) patients: 20/43 IDH1-R132H mutation in IHC, 2/43 IDH1-R132G mutation and 1/43 IDH2-R172K mutation identified by DNA sequencing. 1p/19q codeletion was detected for 23/43 patients. With median follow-up of 19 months (range 1.4-128), median PFS and OS were 22 and 35 months respectively. IDH1/IDH2 mutations were strongly associated with improved PFS and OS: 5-year PFS was 86 versus 6 % and 5-year OS was 91 versus 9 % for patients with IDH1/IDH2 mutations versus wild-type IDH respectively. In multivariate analyses, IDH1/IDH2 mutations and 1p/19q loss were independent prognostic factors. Three groups with distinct prognostic features were identified: patients with IDH1/2 mutations and 1p/19q loss (median PFS, median OS not reached), patients with IDH1/2 mutations or 1p/19q loss (median PFS: 22 months, median OS: 30 months), and patients without IDH1/2 mutations nor 1p/19q loss with a bad prognosis (median PFS: 8.6 months, median OS: 9.9 months).

The 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system (CNS) tumors has been modified to incorporate the IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion in the diagnosis of diffuse gliomas. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility and prognostic significance of the revised 2016 WHO classification of CNS tumors in Mongolian patients with diffuse gliomas. A total of 124 cases of diffuse gliomas were collected, and tissue microarray blocks were made. IDH1 mutation was tested using immunohistochemistry, and 1p/19q co-deletion status was examined using fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. According to the 2016 WHO classification, 124 cases of diffuse brain glioma were reclassified as follows: 10 oligodendroglioma, IDHmut and 1p/19q co-deleted; three anaplastic oligodendroglioma, IDHmut and 1p/19q co-deleted; 35 diffuse astrocytoma, IDHmut, 11 diffuse astrocytoma, IDHwt, not otherwise specified (NOS); 22 anaplastic astrocytoma, IDHmut, eight anaplastic astrocytoma, IDHwt, NOS; and 35 glioblastoma, IDHwt, NOS, respectively. The 2016 WHO classification presented better prognostic value for overall survival in patients with grade II tumors than traditional histological classification. Among patients with grade II tumors, those with oligodendroglioma IDHmut and 1p/19q co-deleted and diffuse astrocytoma IDHmut showed significantly higher survival than those with diffuse astrocytoma IDHwt, NOS (p<.01). Mongolian diffuse gliomas could be reclassified according to the new 2016 WHO classification. Reclassification revealed substantial changes in diagnosis of both oligodendroglial and astrocytic entities.

Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is the latest and perhaps most significant innovation in surgery since Phillipe Mouret of France performed the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1987. This new \"minimum-invasive\" concept that promises scar-free surgery is steadily gathering momentum. It is another milestone in our quest to eliminate surgical trauma, speed patient recovery time and decrease surgical wound-related complications. On 22 July 2005, the Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research (NOSCAR) published a white paper highlighting the barriers to NOTES development, which included the need for appropriate selection of access points, effective closure of the enterotomy site, innovative tools, stable platforms and improved endoscopic orientation. These are just some of the many issues that need to be resolved before the NOTES concept and technique could become a common feature of modern surgery. The publication of the white paper ushered in the beginning of multiple research projects using animal models to test the application of NOTES and its newly developed instruments. The success in animal models was followed by several highly selected successful human trials. National and international surgical innovation departments should now be created where medical industry personnel including inventors, designers and engineers can work together with the medical and surgical providers to address all the limitations affecting NOTES progress.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The efficacy of breast-conserving surgery for the local control of early breast cancer has been repeatedly evidenced. Although immediate reconstruction following breast-conserving surgery has been described, little information is available regarding surgical management in reoperative settings due to positive margins. We studied the influence of intraoperatively assessed and postoperatively controlled surgical margin status on the type of breast-conserving surgery and report our results regarding complications in a reoperative breast reconstruction scenario. All patients were seen by a multidisciplinary team who recommended breast-conserving surgery. According to the breast volume, ptosis and tumor size/location, the patients were also evaluated by a plastic surgeon, who recommended reconstruction with the appropriate technique. Intraoperative assessment of surgical margins was determined by histological examination of frozen sections. The mean follow-up time was 48 months. Two hundred and eighteen patients (88.5%) underwent breast-conserving surgery and immediate reconstruction. Twelve (5.5%) patients had a positive tumor margin after review of the permanent section. All patients underwent re-exploration. In 1.3%, a second reconstructive technique was indicated and in 2.2% a skin-sparing mastectomy with total reconstruction was performed. Our findings support the important role of the intraoperative assessment of surgical margins and its interference in the selection of reconstruction techniques and negative margins; however, it will not guarantee complete excision of the tumor.

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The chaperonin GroEL is a megadalton-sized molecular machine that plays an essential role in the bacterial cell assisting protein folding to the native state through actions requiring ATP binding and hydrolysis. A combination of medicinal chemistry and genetics has been employed to generate an orthogonal pair, a small molecule that selectively inhibits ATPase activity of a GroEL ATP-binding pocket variant. An initial screen of kinase-directed inhibitors identified an active pyrazolo-pyrimidine scaffold that was iteratively modified and screened against a collective of GroEL nucleotide pocket variants to identify a cyclopentyl carboxamide derivative, EC3016, that specifically inhibits ATPase activity and protein folding by the GroEL mutant, I493C, involving a side chain positioned near the base of ATP. This orthogonal pair will enable in vitro studies of the action of ATP in triggering activation of GroEL-mediated protein folding and might enable further studies of GroEL action in vivo. The approach originated for studying kinases by Shokat and his colleagues may thus also be used to study large macromolecular machines.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5.

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the prototype of primary humoral immunodeficiencies. Long-term follow-up studies regarding disease-related complications and outcome are scarce. Our aim was to describe the natural history of XLA. A nationwide multicenter study based on the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry was established in 2000 in Italy. Affected patients were enrolled by documenting centers, and the patients' laboratory, clinical, and imaging data were recorded on an annual base. Data on the patients (N\u00a0= 168) were derived from a cumulative follow-up of 1370 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 8.35 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis decreased after establishment of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry (84 months before vs 23 months after). Respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent clinical symptoms at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Regular immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduced the incidence of invasive infections. Affected patients developed chronic lung disease over time (47% after 40 years of follow-up) in the presence of chronic sinusitis (84%). Malignancies were documented in a minority of cases (3.7%). Overall survival for affected patients was significantly reduced when compared with that for the healthy male Italian population, and it further deteriorated in the presence of chronic lung disease. This is the first detailed long-term follow-up study for patients with XLA, revealing that although immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduces the incidence of invasive infections, it does not appear to influence the development of chronic lung disease. The overall survival of affected patients is reduced. Further studies are warranted to improve patients' clinical management and increase awareness among physicians.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) reduce febrile neutropaenia (FN) incidence but may be used inconsistently in current practice (CP). This study compared the efficacy of pegfilgrastim primary prophylaxis (PPP) with CP neutropaenia management in breast cancer. Individual patient data (N=2282) from 11 clinical trials and observational studies using chemotherapy regimens with > or =15% FN risk and PPP (6 mg, all cycles) or CP (no G-CSF or any cycle G-CSF/pegfilgrastim) were included in an integrated analysis. Most patients received docetaxel-containing regimens. A generalised linear mixed model was fitted (N=2210). Neutropaenia prophylaxis (PPP versus CP), age and disease stage influenced the incidence of FN. Overall, FN was less frequent with PPP than with CP (odds ratio [OR]: 0.124; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08, 0.194; P<0.0001). Odds for cycle 1 FN, dose reductions > or =15% and FN-related hospitalisation were also significantly lower with PPP. These data support PPP in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with moderately high/high FN risk.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Cytochrome P450 1A1 is a major enzyme in the bioactivation of exogenous procarcinogens of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the contribution of common genetic variants in CYP1A1 to the HCC risk in Chinese populations has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we examined the association between HCC and four selected tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP1A1, and the risk of CYP1A1 haplotypes/diplotypes in 1006 pathologically confirmed HCC patients and 1015 cancer-free controls, from a Han Chinese population. Haplotypes/diplotypes were constructed from observed genotypes using the Haplo.Stats program. Relative risk was estimated by using multivariable logistic regression method. To summarise, we detected an increased HCC risk in rs4646421 variant carriers (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.61) and rs2198843 variant carriers (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.69), and a reduced risk of HCC (OR 0.70. 95% CI 0.52-0.94) associated with homozygote carriers of rs4886605 variant. These association signals were also observed in non-smokers with rs4646421 (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.16-2.08) and rs4886605 (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.91). Compared to the most common CYP1A1 haplotype CCAG, the haplotype TTGC conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.52). Similarly, the TTGC/TTGC diplotype conferred an increased risk of HCC compared with diplotype CCAG/CCAG (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.23-3.45, P=0.006). Interestingly, the diplotype TTAC/CCAG also conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.22-2.54, P=0.003). Our results suggested that common genetic variants in CYP1A1 may modulate the risk of developing HCC in the study population, particularly in non-smokers. However, our findings need to be validated in at least one independent study of Han Chinese population.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The thymus is critical for central tolerance and diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire development, to provide lifelong defense against pathogens while maintaining self-tolerance. Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Insects and fungi share a long history of association in various habitats, including the wood-decomposition niche. Fungal mimicry of termite eggs is one of the most striking evolutionary consequences of insect-fungus association. Termites of the genus Reticulitermes often harbor fungal sclerotia, called \"termite balls,\" along with eggs in nursery chambers, whereby the fungus gains a competitor-free habitat in termite nests. Sophisticated morphological and chemical camouflage are needed for the fungus to mimic termite eggs. However, the mechanism of chemical egg mimicry by the fungus is unknown. Here, we show that the fungus mimics termite eggs chemically by producing the cellulose-digesting enzyme beta-glucosidase. We found that the termite egg-recognition pheromone consists of beta-glucosidase and lysozyme. Both enzymes are major salivary compounds in termites and are also produced in termite eggs. Termite balls were tended by termites only when the fungus produced beta-glucosidase. Our results demonstrated that the overlap of the cellulose digestion niche between termites and the fungus sharing the same chemicals provided the opportunity for the origin of termite egg mimicry by the fungus. This suggests that pheromone compounds might have originally evolved within other life history contexts, only later gaining function in chemical communication.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds.

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

While on foraging excursions, fiddler crabs track their burrow location despite having no visual contact with it . They do this by path integration, a common navigational process in which motion vectors (the direction and distance of animals' movements) are summed to form a single \"home vector\" linking the current location with the point of origin. Here, we identify the mechanism by which the integrator measures distance, by decoupling motor output from both inertial and visual feedback. Fiddler crabs were passively translated to a position such that the home vector lay across an acetate sheet on the ground. After being frightened, crabs tried to escape but slipped as they did so. Detailed high-speed video analysis reveals that crabs measure distance by integrating strides, rather than linear acceleration or optic flow: the number of steps they took depended on both the length of the home vector and how large their steps were, whether they slipped and fell short or not. This is the most direct evidence to date of a stride integrator that is flexible enough to account for significant variation in stride length and frequency.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Sunlight is attenuated rapidly in the ocean, resulting in little visually useful light reaching deeper than approximately 1000 m in even the clearest water. To maximize sensitivity to the relatively brighter downwelling sunlight, to view the silhouette of animals above them, and to increase the binocular overlap of their eyes, many mesopelagic animals have developed upward-pointing tubular eyes. However, these sacrifice the ability to detect bioluminescent and reflective objects in other directions. Thus, some mesopelagic fish with tubular eyes extend their visual fields laterally and/or ventrally by lensless ocular diverticula, which are thought to provide unfocused images, allowing only simple detection of objects, with little spatial resolution. Here, we show that a medial mirror within the ventrally facing ocular diverticulum of the spookfish, Dolichopteryx longipes, consisting of a multilayer stack derived from a retinal tapetum, is used to reflect light onto a lateral retina. The reflective plates are not orientated parallel to the surface of the mirror. Instead, plate angles change progressively around the mirror, and computer modeling indicates that this provides a well-focused image. This is the first report of an ocular image being formed in a vertebrate eye by a mirror.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

LKB1 kinase is a tumor suppressor that is causally linked to Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. In complex with the pseudokinase STRAD and the scaffolding protein MO25, LKB1 phosphorylates and activates AMPK family kinases, which mediate many cellular processes. The prototypical family member AMPK regulates cell energy metabolism and epithelial apicobasal polarity. This latter event is also dependent on E-cadherin-mediated adherens junctions (AJs) at lateral borders. Strikingly, overexpression of LKB1/STRAD can also trigger establishment of epithelial polarity in the absence of cell-cell or cell-matrix contacts. However, the upstream factors that normally govern LKB1/STRAD function are unknown. Here we show by immunostaining and fluorescence resonance energy transfer that active LKB1/STRAD kinase complex colocalizes with E-cadherin at AJs. LKB1/STRAD localization and AMPK phosphorylation require E-cadherin-dependent maturation of AJs. However, LKB1/STRAD complex kinase activity is E-cadherin independent. These data suggest that in polarized epithelial cells, E-cadherin regulates AMPK phosphorylation by controlling the localization of the LKB1 complex. The LKB1 complex therefore appears to function downstream of E-cadherin in tumor suppression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

A novel automated chemiluminescence (CL) read-out system for analytical flow-through microarrays based on multiplexed immunoassays has been developed. The microarray chip reader (MCR 3) is designed as a stand-alone platform, with the goal to quantify multiple analytes in complex matrices of food and liquid samples for field analysis or for routine analytical laboratories. The CL microarray platform is a self-contained system for the fully automated multiplexed immunoanalysis: the microarray chip, the fluidic system and the software module enable automated calibration and determination of analyte concentrations during a whole working day. The detection of antibiotics in milk was demonstrated to validate this device. There are few quantitative multi-residue detection methods for routine analysis although the EU has defined maximum residue limits (MRLs) for a number of antibacterial reagents. Therefore, an automated multianalyte detection instrument is needed quantifying simultaneously antibiotics within some minutes. Also regeneration is required to avoid replacing the assay surface. The MCR 3 uses a microarray chip, which consists of two channels for parallel measurement and regeneration. The microarray chip is designed for parallel analysis of up to 13 different antibiotics in milk applying an indirect competitive microarray immunoassay (MIA). Microspotted antibiotics are directly coupled to epoxylated PEG surfaces. As an initial example, penicillin G is quantified in milk on the MCR 3. The penicillin G surface is regenerable for 47 measurement cycles per channel. A limit of detection (LOD) of 1.1 microg/L is achieved by an assay time of 6 min.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Probing microarray assays in the presence of a hybridization mix retrieves precious information on hybridization kinetics. However, in common detection schemes, useful surface signals compete with the high supernatant background from labelled targets in the mix. A known solution consists in exciting specifically the microarray surface with evanescent fields. Configurations using planar optical waveguides to produce such fields are shown here to present also a dramatic excitation irradiance enhancement at the guide/surrounding matter interface. We compare theoretically and experimentally a guided excitation with a classical external excitation. A full electromagnetic analysis predicts an irradiance increase higher than 10(4) for adequately tailored waveguides. We deposited high-index TiO(2) sol-gel waveguides on glass substrates according to best simulations. Quantitative enhancement analysis exploiting actual biological fluorescent spots perfectly confirms the irradiance amplification effect of a thin waveguide.

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Successful execution of CRISPR/Cas-based splicing modulation indicates that our CRISPR/Cas-based targeted modification of splicing sites is a useful approach to study specific isoforms of a transcript generated by alternative splicing. Upon differentiation of splicing-mutant Xist female ES cells, we find that both long and short Xist isoforms can induce X-chromosome inactivation normally during ES cell differentiation, suggesting that the short splicing isoform of Xist RNA is sufficient to induce X-chromosome inactivation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Xist encodes a long noncoding RNA which is a central player to induce X-chromosome inactivation in female mammals and has two major splicing variants: long and short isoforms of Xist RNA.\"]}"}]}

Expression profiling to characterize cancer pharmacology has become a new approach to discover novel molecular targets for prognostic markers and cancer therapy. In a study to compare the global RNA expression profiles between primary and recurrent ovarian tumors from the same patient, we have identified XIST (inactive X chromosome-specific transcripts) as the most differentially expressed gene that was down-regulated in the recurrent tumor. XIST encodes a spliced noncoding polyadenylated transcript that is unique in being expressed exclusively from the inactive X chromosome and is involved in the X-inactivation process. Subsequent characterization of XIST expression in a panel of female cancer cell lines showed that the expression level of XIST correlates significantly with Taxol sensitivity. The clinical relevance of this observation is demonstrated by the strong association between XIST RNA levels and disease-free periods of ovarian cancer patients in a group of 21 ovarian cancer cases with Taxol in the therapeutic regiments. Cytogenetic studies on ovarian cancer cell lines indicated that loss of inactive X chromosome is one mechanism for the loss of XIST transcripts in the cell lines. Our data suggest that XIST expression may be a potential marker for chemotherapeutic responses in ovarian cancer.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"XIST encodes a spliced noncoding polyadenylated transcript that is unique in being expressed exclusively from the inactive X chromosome and is involved in the X-inactivation process.\"]}"}]}

To further examine the behavior of XIST transgenes when expressed from ectopic sites, we introduced an XIST-containing PAC into the human male somatic cell line HT-1080. In five different transformant clones, the degree of localization and associated DNA condensation of the surrounding chromatin varied within nuclei of the same clone, as well as among different clones. Comparing the number of integrated transgenes and the levels of XIST expression revealed that neither factor was sufficient for a tight localization of the XIST signal. Therefore, the extent of expression and localization of XIST transcripts from ectopic transgenes is likely dependent upon many interacting factors, including the number of integrated transgenes, the level of XIST expression, and the site of integration.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"XIST encodes a functional RNA that is expressed exclusively from the inactive X in female mammals and is required for the silencing of most of the genes on the chromosome.

Dosage compensation in mammals is achieved by the transcriptional inactivation of one X chromosome in female cells. From the time X chromosome inactivation was initially described, it was clear that several mechanisms must be precisely integrated to achieve correct regulation of this complex process. X-inactivation appears to be triggered upon differentiation, suggesting its regulation by developmental cues. Whereas any number of X chromosomes greater than one is silenced, only one X chromosome remains active. Silencing on the inactive X chromosome coincides with the acquisition of a multitude of chromatin modifications, resulting in the formation of extraordinarily stable facultative heterochromatin that is faithfully propagated through subsequent cell divisions. The integration of all these processes requires a region of the X chromosome known as the X-inactivation center, which contains the Xist gene and its cis-regulatory elements. Xist encodes an RNA molecule that plays critical roles in the choice of which X chromosome remains active, and in the initial spread and establishment of silencing on the inactive X chromosome.

In female cells with mutated polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (Ptbp1), differentiation fails to substantially upregulate mature Xist RNA because of a defect in Xist splicing. We further found both Xist129 and XistCAS RNA are unspliced in Mus musculus 129SvJ/Mus castaneous (CAS) hybrid female ES cells. Upon differentiation, Xist129 exhibits a higher splicing efficiency than XistCAS, likely contributing to preferential inhibition of the X129 chromosome. Single cell analysis shows that the allelic choice of Xist splicing is linked to the inactive X chromosome. We conclude post-transcriptional control of Xist RNA splicing is an essential regulatory step of Xist induction. Our studies shed light on the developmental roles of splicing for nuclear-retained Xist lncRNA and suggest inefficient Xist splicing is an additional fail-safe mechanism to prevent Xist activity in ES cells.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"X-inactive-specific transcript (Xist) is a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) essential for inactivating one of the two X chromosomes in mammalian females.\"]}"}]}

X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is thought to catalyze silencing of X-linked genes in cis during X-chromosome inactivation, which equalizes X-linked gene dosage between male and female mammals. To test the impact of Xist RNA on X-linked gene silencing, we ectopically induced endogenous Xist by ablating the antisense repressor Tsix in mice. We find that ectopic Xist RNA induction and subsequent X-linked gene silencing is sex specific in embryos and in differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). A higher frequency of X(\u0394Tsix)Y male cells displayed ectopic Xist RNA coating compared with X(\u0394Tsix)X female cells. This increase reflected the inability of X(\u0394Tsix)Y cells to efficiently silence X-linked genes compared with X(\u0394Tsix)X cells, despite equivalent Xist RNA induction and coating. Silencing of genes on both Xs resulted in significantly reduced proliferation and increased cell death in X(\u0394Tsix)X female cells relative to X(\u0394Tsix)Y male cells. Thus, whereas Xist RNA can inactivate the X chromosome in females it may not do so in males. We further found comparable silencing in differentiating X(\u0394Tsix)Y and 39,X(\u0394Tsix) (X(\u0394Tsix)O) ESCs, excluding the Y chromosome and instead implicating the X-chromosome dose as the source of the sex-specific differences. Because X(\u0394Tsix)X female embryonic epiblast cells and EpiSCs harbor an inactivated X chromosome prior to ectopic inactivation of the active X(\u0394Tsix) X chromosome, we propose that the increased expression of one or more X-inactivation escapees activates Xist and, separately, helps trigger X-linked gene silencing. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is thought to catalyze silencing of X-linked genes in cis during X-chromosome inactivation, which equalizes X-linked gene dosage between male and female mammals.\"]}"}]}

X inactivation, the transcriptional silencing of one of the two X chromosomes in female mammals, achieves dosage compensation of X-linked genes relative to XY males. In eutherian mammals X inactivation is regulated by the X-inactive specific transcript (Xist), a cis-acting non-coding RNA that triggers silencing of the chromosome from which it is transcribed. Marsupial mammals also undergo X inactivation but the mechanism is relatively poorly understood. We set out to analyse the X chromosome in Monodelphis domestica and Didelphis virginiana, focusing on characterizing the interval defined by the Chic1 and Slc16a2 genes that in eutherians flank the Xist locus. The synteny of this region is retained on chicken chromosome 4 where other loci belonging to the evolutionarily ancient stratum of the human X chromosome, the so-called X conserved region (XCR), are also located. We show that in both M. domestica and D. virginiana an evolutionary breakpoint has separated the Chic1 and Slc16a2 loci. Detailed analysis of opossum genomic sequences revealed linkage of Chic1 with the Lnx3 gene, recently proposed to be the evolutionary precursor of Xist, and Fip1, the evolutionary precursor of Tsx, a gene located immediately downstream of Xist in eutherians.

The long noncoding X-inactivation-specific transcript (Xist gene) is responsible for mammalian X-chromosome dosage compensation between the sexes, the process by which one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated in the female soma. Xist is essential for both the random and imprinted forms of X-chromosome inactivation. In the imprinted form, Xist is paternally marked to be expressed in female embryos. To investigate the mechanism of Xist imprinting, we introduce Xist transgenes (Tg) into the male germ line. Although ectopic high-level Xist expression on autosomes can be compatible with viability, transgenic animals demonstrate reduced fitness, subfertility, defective meiotic pairing, and other germ-cell abnormalities. In the progeny, paternal-specific expression is recapitulated by the 200-kb Xist Tg. However, Xist imprinting occurs efficiently only when it is in an unpaired or unpartnered state during male meiosis. When transmitted from a hemizygous father (+/Tg), the Xist Tg demonstrates paternal-specific expression in the early embryo. When transmitted by a homozygous father (Tg/Tg), the Tg fails to show imprinted expression. Thus, Xist imprinting is directed by sequences within a 200-kb X-linked region, and the hemizygous (unpaired) state of the Xist region promotes its imprinting in the male germ line. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The long noncoding X-inactivation-specific transcript (Xist gene) is responsible for mammalian X-chromosome dosage compensation between the sexes, the process by which one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated in the female soma.\"]}"}]}

Combining RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with immunofluorescence (immuno-FISH) creates a technique that can be employed at the single cell level to detect the spatial dynamics of RNA localization with simultaneous insight into the localization of proteins, epigenetic modifications and other details which can be highlighted by immunofluorescence. X-chromosome inactivation is a paradigm for long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-mediated gene silencing.

One known epigenetic hallmark of the Xi is the Histone H3 trimethyl-lysine 27 (H3K27me3) modification. Here, we describe a simple and quick immuno-FISH protocol for detecting Xist RNA using RNA FISH with multiple oligonucleotide probes coupled with immunofluorescence of H3K27me3 to examine the localization of Xist RNA and associated epigenetic modifications. Using oligonucleotide probes results in a shorter incubation time and more sensitive detection of Xist RNA compared to in vitro transcribed RNA probes (riboprobes).

X-chromosome inactivation silences one X chromosome in females to achieve dosage compensation with the single X chromosome in males. While most genes are silenced on the inactive X chromosome, the gene for the long non-coding RNA XIST is silenced on the active X chromosome and expressed from the inactive X chromosome with which the XIST RNA associates, triggering silencing of the chromosome. In mouse, an alternative Xist promoter, P2 is also the site of YY1 binding, which has been shown to serve as a tether between the Xist RNA and the DNA of the chromosome. In humans there are many differences from the initial events of mouse Xist activation, including absence of a functional antisense regulator Tsix, and absence of strictly paternal inactivation in extraembryonic tissues, prompting us to examine regulatory regions for the human XIST gene. We demonstrate that the female-specific DNase hypersensitivity site within XIST is specific to the inactive X chromosome and correlates with transcription from an internal P2 promoter. P2 is located within a CpG island that is differentially methylated between males and females and overlaps conserved YY1 binding sites that are only bound on the inactive X chromosome where the sites are unmethylated. However, YY1 binding is insufficient to drive P2 expression or establish the DHS, which may require a development-specific factor. Furthermore, reduction of YY1 reduces XIST transcription in addition to causing delocalization of XIST. The differentially methylated DNase hypersensitive site within XIST marks the location of an alternative promoter, P2, that generates a transcript of unknown function as it lacks the A repeats that are critical for silencing. In addition, this region binds YY1 on the unmethylated inactive X chromosome, and depletion of YY1 untethers the XIST RNA as well as decreasing transcription of XIST.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"While most genes are silenced on the inactive X chromosome, the gene for the long non-coding RNA XIST is silenced on the active X chromosome and expressed from the inactive X chromosome with which the XIST RNA associates, triggering silencing of the chromosome.\"]}"}]}

Early development of female mammals is accompanied by transcriptional inactivation of one of their two X chromosomes. This process, known as X-chromosome inactivation, relies on monoallelic activation of the Xist gene. Xist produces a non-coding RNA that can coat the chromosome from which it is transcribed in cis and trigger its silencing. How Xist expression is controlled and how it initiates transcriptional repression are central questions for our understanding of how this chromosome-wide monoallelic program is expressed. Several trans-acting factors have been identified as regulators of Xist expression. Interestingly, some Xist activators are encoded by the X chromosome itself, thereby efficiently promoting Xist expression in females (XX) but not in males (XY). Female cells also display transient physical pairing between their two X chromosomes at the level of their Xics (X inactivation centers) during the time window when X inactivation is initiated. It has been proposed that these pairing events may play a role in Xist activation and its monoallelic regulation. Xist RNA accumulates over the X chromosome from which it is expressed and rapidly triggers the exclusion of the transcription machinery. Genic sequences are initially located outside of this Xist RNA coated domain but as they become progressively silenced they are relocated into this silent nuclear compartment created by Xist. However genes are not all silenced with the same kinetics. Furthermore, some genes can escape X inactivation and remain located outside the Xist-coated compartment. Recent findings have revealed that young, active LINE-1 retrotransposons are expressed from the inactive X chromosome and may facilitate X inactivation, particularly in regions of the X that would otherwise be prone to escape.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"This process, known as X-chromosome inactivation, relies on monoallelic activation of the Xist gene.

The X chromosome is unique in the genome. In this review we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the genetics and epigenetics of the X chromosome. The X chromosome shares limited conservation with its ancestral homologue the Y chromosome and the resulting difference in X-chromosome dosage between males and females is largely compensated for by X-chromosome inactivation. The process of inactivation is initiated by the long non-coding RNA X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) and achieved through interaction with multiple synergistic silencing pathways. Identification of Xist-interacting proteins has given insight into these processes yet the cascade of events from initiation to maintenance have still to be resolved. In particular, the initiation of inactivation in humans has been challenging to study as: it occurs very early in development; most human embryonic stem cell lines already have an inactive X; and the process seems to differ from mouse. Another difference between human and mouse X inactivation is the larger number of human genes that escape silencing. In humans over 20% of X-linked genes continue to be expressed from the otherwise inactive X chromosome. We are only beginning to understand how such escape occurs but there is growing recognition that escapees contribute to sexually dimorphic traits. The unique biology and epigenetics of the X chromosome have often led to its exclusion from disease studies, yet the X constitutes 5% of the genome and is an important contributor to disease, often in a sex-specific manner.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The process of inactivation is initiated by the long non-coding RNA X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) and achieved through interaction with multiple synergistic silencing pathways.\"]}"}]}

In female mammals, one of the two X chromosomes becomes genetically silenced to compensate for dosage imbalance of X-linked genes between XX females and XY males. X chromosome inactivation (X-inactivation) is a classical model for epigenetic gene regulation in mammals and has been studied for half a century. In the last two decades, efforts have been focused on the X inactive-specific transcript (Xist) locus, discovered to be the master regulator of X-inactivation. The Xist gene produces a non-coding RNA that functions as the primary switch for X-inactivation, coating the X chromosome from which it is transcribed in cis. Significant progress has been made towards understanding how Xist is regulated at the onset of X-inactivation, but our understanding of the molecular basis of silencing mediated by Xist RNA has progressed more slowly. A picture has, however, begun to emerge, and new tools and resources hold out the promise of further advances to come.

Xist (X-inactive specific transcript) plays a crucial role in X-inactivation. This non-coding RNA becomes upregulated on the X chromosome that is to be inactivated upon differentiation. Previous studies have revealed that although maintenance-type DNA methylation is not essential for X-inactivation to occur, it is required for the stable repression of Xist in differentiated cells. However, it is unknown whether differential de novo methylation at the Xist promoter, which is mediated by Dnmt3a and/or Dnmt3b, is a cause or a consequence of monoallelic expression of Xist. We show that Xist expression is appropriately regulated in the absence of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b and that a single X chromosome undergoes proper inactivation in mutant females. Our results indicate that a mechanism(s) other than DNA methylation plays a principal role in initiating X-inactivation. We also demonstrate that delayed upregulation of Xist does not induce X-inactivation, consistent with a crucial developmental window for the chromosomal silencing.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Xist (X-inactive specific transcript) plays a crucial role in X-inactivation.

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Carvedilol suppressed apoptosis of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC through modification of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, whose was associated with an increase of Cav 1.2 protein expression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the prototype of primary humoral immunodeficiencies. Long-term follow-up studies regarding disease-related complications and outcome are scarce. Our aim was to describe the natural history of XLA. A nationwide multicenter study based on the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry was established in 2000 in Italy. Affected patients were enrolled by documenting centers, and the patients' laboratory, clinical, and imaging data were recorded on an annual base. Data on the patients (N\u00a0= 168) were derived from a cumulative follow-up of 1370 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 8.35 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis decreased after establishment of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry (84 months before vs 23 months after). Respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent clinical symptoms at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Regular immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduced the incidence of invasive infections. Affected patients developed chronic lung disease over time (47% after 40 years of follow-up) in the presence of chronic sinusitis (84%). Malignancies were documented in a minority of cases (3.7%). Overall survival for affected patients was significantly reduced when compared with that for the healthy male Italian population, and it further deteriorated in the presence of chronic lung disease. This is the first detailed long-term follow-up study for patients with XLA, revealing that although immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduces the incidence of invasive infections, it does not appear to influence the development of chronic lung disease. The overall survival of affected patients is reduced. Further studies are warranted to improve patients' clinical management and increase awareness among physicians.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

A novel automated chemiluminescence (CL) read-out system for analytical flow-through microarrays based on multiplexed immunoassays has been developed. The microarray chip reader (MCR 3) is designed as a stand-alone platform, with the goal to quantify multiple analytes in complex matrices of food and liquid samples for field analysis or for routine analytical laboratories. The CL microarray platform is a self-contained system for the fully automated multiplexed immunoanalysis: the microarray chip, the fluidic system and the software module enable automated calibration and determination of analyte concentrations during a whole working day. The detection of antibiotics in milk was demonstrated to validate this device. There are few quantitative multi-residue detection methods for routine analysis although the EU has defined maximum residue limits (MRLs) for a number of antibacterial reagents. Therefore, an automated multianalyte detection instrument is needed quantifying simultaneously antibiotics within some minutes. Also regeneration is required to avoid replacing the assay surface. The MCR 3 uses a microarray chip, which consists of two channels for parallel measurement and regeneration. The microarray chip is designed for parallel analysis of up to 13 different antibiotics in milk applying an indirect competitive microarray immunoassay (MIA). Microspotted antibiotics are directly coupled to epoxylated PEG surfaces. As an initial example, penicillin G is quantified in milk on the MCR 3. The penicillin G surface is regenerable for 47 measurement cycles per channel. A limit of detection (LOD) of 1.1 microg/L is achieved by an assay time of 6 min.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group.

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects.

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant.

Probing microarray assays in the presence of a hybridization mix retrieves precious information on hybridization kinetics. However, in common detection schemes, useful surface signals compete with the high supernatant background from labelled targets in the mix. A known solution consists in exciting specifically the microarray surface with evanescent fields. Configurations using planar optical waveguides to produce such fields are shown here to present also a dramatic excitation irradiance enhancement at the guide/surrounding matter interface. We compare theoretically and experimentally a guided excitation with a classical external excitation. A full electromagnetic analysis predicts an irradiance increase higher than 10(4) for adequately tailored waveguides. We deposited high-index TiO(2) sol-gel waveguides on glass substrates according to best simulations. Quantitative enhancement analysis exploiting actual biological fluorescent spots perfectly confirms the irradiance amplification effect of a thin waveguide. The impact of amplification on the design of biochip readers is discussed since it leaves ample margin for simple and low-cost light couplers, advantageous in affordable readers and sensor systems.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The thymus is critical for central tolerance and diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire development, to provide lifelong defense against pathogens while maintaining self-tolerance. Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

We developed a stable, sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on the synthesis of a new sol-gel material with the ion-exchange capacity sol-gel to coimmobilize the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and enzyme. The partial sulfonated (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane sol-gel (PSSG) film acted as both an ion exchanger for the immobilization of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and a matrix to immobilize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The AuNPs/PSSG/Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) film modified electrode allowed sensitive the ECL detection of NADH as low as 1 nM. Such an ability of AuNPs/PSSG/Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) film to promote the electron transfer between Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and the electrode suggested a new, promising biocompatible platform for the development of dehydrogenase-based ECL biosensors.

While we welcome positive results for this unmet need, three issues are raised by the trial. First, the control arm was restricted, precluding important options. Second, post-progression treatment was provided to a smaller fraction of patients than in real-life, which raises the question of whether overall survival was negatively impacted by limited care after the trial ended. Finally, the discrepancy between overall survival and progression-free survival benefit is an outlier in the context of previous melanoma trials.

Treatment of primary intraocular uveal melanoma has developed considerably, its driver genes are largely unraveled, and the ways to assess its risk for metastases are very precise, being based on an international staging system and genetic data. Unfortunately, the risk of distant metastases, which emerge in approximately one half of all patients, is unaltered. Metastases are the leading single cause of death after uveal melanoma is diagnosed, yet no consensus exists regarding surveillance, staging, and treatment of disseminated disease, and survival has not improved until recently. The final frontier in conquering uveal melanoma lies in solving these issues to cure metastatic disease. Most studies on metastatic uveal melanoma are small, uncontrolled, retrospective, and do not report staging. Meta-analyses confirm a median overall survival of 10-13 months, and a cure rate that approaches nil, although survival exceeding 5 years is possible, estimated 2% either with first-line treatment or with best supportive care. Hepatic ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging as surveillance methods have a sensitivity of 95-100% and 83-100%, respectively, to detect metastases without radiation hazard according to prevailing evidence, but computed tomography is necessary for staging. No blood-based tests additional to liver function tests are generally accepted. Three validated staging systems predict, each in defined situations, overall survival after metastasis. Their essential components include measures of tumor burden, liver function, and performance status or metastasis free interval. Age and gender may additionally influence survival. Exceptional mutational events in metastases may make them susceptible to checkpoint inhibitors. In a large meta-analysis, surgical treatment was associated with 6 months longer median overall survival as compared to conventional chemotherapy and, recently, tebentafusp as first-line treatment at the first interim analysis of a randomized phase III trial likewise provided a 6 months longer median overall survival compared to investigator's choice, mostly pembrolizumab; these treatments currently apply to selected patients. Promoting dormancy of micrometastases, harmonizing surveillance protocols, promoting staging, identifying predictive factors, initiating controlled clinical trials, and standardizing reporting will be critical steppingstones in reaching the final frontier of curing metastatic uveal melanoma.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"In a large meta-analysis, surgical treatment was associated with 6 months longer median overall survival as compared to conventional chemotherapy and, recently, tebentafusp as first-line treatment at the first interim analysis of a randomized phase III trial likewise provided a 6 months longer median overall survival compared to investigator's choice, mostly pembrolizumab; these treatments currently apply to selected patients. \"]}"}]}

The purpose of this study was to use the rat air pouch model of facsimile synovium to evaluate oxidative stress as a primary mechanism in the pathogenesis of degenerative temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disease. Forty-nine Sprague-Dawley adult female rats were used to generate the standard rat air pouch model of facsimile synovium. This was accomplished by daily air injections (20 cc) subdermally through the dorsal skin. Hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron (components of the Fenton reaction which generate free radicals) were introduced into the pouches of the 4-, 7-, and 14-day groups to generate oxidative stress. Control rats were injected with phosphate-buffered solution (PBS), pH 7.4. Either N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a powerful free radical scavenger, or ibuprofen were simultaneously injected with the Fenton reagents into the pouches of the 14-day treatment groups to modulate free radical-mediated protein damage to the synovium. Animals were euthanized at appropriate experimental intervals and biopsies obtained from specimens to analyze: (1) proteins' amino acid modification (carbonyl group formation), (2) protein hydrophobicity, (3) detection of low molecular weight protein degradation products, and (4) histological and gross anatomical observations. Free radicals introduced into the rat air pouch interacted with synovial tissues causing oxidation and breakdown of proteins. Clinical evidence of adhesion formation consistent with features found in osteoarthritis of the TMJ developed. The groups subjected to oxidative stress experienced statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in carbonyl formation, carbonyls/protein, and low molecular weight protein fragments. These groups also showed significant (p < 0.05) hydrophobicity changes consistent with free radical attack. Control synovial tissues were statistically undamaged. The 14-day NAC and ibuprofen treatment groups experienced statistically significant (p < 0.05) decreases in total carbonyl formation, carbonyls/protein, and hydrophobicity. Histological and gross observations in free radical damaged synovium exhibited features consistent with known arthoscopic and arthrocentesis findings in diseased TMJs. This study suggests that the rat air pouch model of facsimile synovium develops clinical evidence of adhesions and biochemical signs of protein modification when subjected to free radical attack. NAC and ibuprofen prevented carbonyl formation as well as hydrophobicity changes indicative of oxidative stress damage in facsimile synovium. These findings are consistent with features of degenerative human TMJ disease. Future direction may be taken from this study to postulate new analysis techniques and treatment modalities for patients with degenerative TMJ disease.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron (components of the Fenton reaction which generate free radicals) \"]}"}]}

Oxidative stress plays a central role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Iron, a potent generator of hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton reaction, has been implicated in AMD. One easily oxidized molecule is docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid in photoreceptor membranes. Oxidation of DHA produces toxic oxidation products including carboxyethylpyrrole (CEP) adducts, which are increased in the retinas of AMD patients. In this study, we hypothesized that deuterium substitution on the bis-allylic sites of DHA in photoreceptor membranes could prevent iron-induced retinal degeneration by inhibiting oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Mice were fed with either DHA deuterated at the oxidation-prone positions (D-DHA) or control natural DHA and then given an intravitreal injection of iron or control saline. Orally administered D-DHA caused a dose-dependent increase in D-DHA levels in the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) as measured by mass spectrometry. At 1\u00a0week after iron injection, D-DHA provided nearly complete protection against iron-induced retinal autofluorescence and retinal degeneration, as determined by in vivo imaging, electroretinography, and histology. Iron injection resulted in carboxyethylpyrrole conjugate immunoreactivity in photoreceptors and RPE in mice fed with natural DHA but not D-DHA. Quantitative PCR results were consistent with iron-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and retinal cell death in mice fed with natural DHA but not D-DHA. Taken together, our findings suggest that DHA oxidation is central to the pathogenesis of iron-induced retinal degeneration. They also provide preclinical evidence that dosing with D-DHA could be a viable therapeutic strategy for retinal diseases involving oxidative stress.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Oxidative stress plays a central role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Accumulation of the lipid-protein complex ceroid is a characteristic of atherosclerotic plaque. The mechanism of ceroid formation has been extensively studied, because the complex is postulated to contribute to plaque irreversibility. Despite intensive research, ceroid deposits are defined through their fluorescence and histochemical staining properties, while their composition remains unknown. Using Raman and fluorescence spectral microscopy, we examine the composition of ceroid in situ in aorta and coronary artery plaque. The synergy of these two types of spectroscopy allows for identification of ceroid via its fluorescence signature and elucidation of its chemical composition through the acquisition of a Raman spectrum. In accordance with in vitro predictions, low density lipoprotein (LDL) appears within the deposits primarily in its peroxidized form. The main forms of modified LDL detected in both coronary artery and aortic plaques are peroxidation products from the Fenton reaction and myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite pathway. These two peroxidation products occur in similar concentrations within the deposits and represent \u223c40 and 30% of the total LDL (native and peroxidized) in the aorta and coronary artery deposits, respectively. To our knowledge, this study is the first to successfully employ Raman spectroscopy to unravel a metabolic pathway involved in disease pathogenesis: the formation of ceroid in atherosclerotic plaque.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The main forms of modified LDL detected in both coronary artery and aortic plaques are peroxidation products from the Fenton reaction and myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite pathway. \"]}"}]}

In this study we have tested an idea on the important role of amine oxidases (semicarbazide-sensitive\namine oxidase, diamine oxidase, polyamine oxidase) as an additional source of oxidative/carbonyl stress\nunder glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis, since the enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species and reactive\ncarbonyl species in a variety of tissues is linked to various diseases. In our experiments we used the sensitive\nfluorescent method devised for estimation of amine oxidases activity in the rat kidney and thymus as targeted\norgans under rhabdomyolysis. We have found in vivo the multiple rises in activity of semicarbazide-sensitive\namine oxidase, diamine oxidase, polyamine oxidase (2-4.5 times) in the corresponding cell fractions, whole\ncells or their lysates at the 3-6th day after glycerol injection. Aberrant antioxidant activities depended on\nrhabdomyolysis stage and had organ specificity. Additional treatment of animals with metal chelator \u2018Unithiol\u2019\nadjusted only the activity of antioxidant enzymes but not amine oxidases in both organs. Furthermore the in\nvitro experiment showed that Fenton reaction (hydrogen peroxide in the presence of iron) products alone had\nno effect on semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activity in rat liver cell fraction whereas supplementation\nwith methylglyoxal resulted in its significant 2.5-fold enhancement. Combined action of the both agents had\nadditive effect on semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activity. We can assume that biogenic amine and\npolyamine catabolism by amine oxidases is upregulated by oxidative and carbonyl stress factors directly\nunder rhabdomyolysis progression, and the increase in catabolic products concentration contributes to tissue\ndamage in glycerol-induced acute renal failure and apoptosis stimulation in thymus.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Furthermore the in\\nvitro experiment showed that Fenton reaction (hydrogen peroxide in the presence of iron) products alone had\\nno effect on semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activity in rat liver cell fraction whereas supplementation\\nwith methylglyoxal resulted in its significant 2.5-fold enhancement.\"]}"}]}

The reaction of iron(ii) and hydrogen peroxide, namely the Fenton reaction, is well-known for its strong oxidizing capability. While the Fenton reactions are ubiquitous and have wide applications in many areas, the detailed mechanism, especially the nature of the reactive intermediates responsible for oxidation, is not completely clear. In this work, the performances of various density functional theory (DFT) methods on the relative energies of key Fenton intermediates are evaluated. The DFT method selected from the benchmark study is then exploited to investigate the aqueous Fenton reactions in different pH conditions. The results show that at pH > 2.2, the major Fenton oxidants are high-valent oxoiron(iv) aquo complexes. However, depending on the pH conditions, these complexes can exist in three protonation states that display quite different oxidation reactivities. The oxidizing power of FeIV[double bond, length as m-dash]O is found to be principally determined by the total charge of the ligands and is less influenced by the axial ligand effect. Moreover, the calculations reveal that the presence of the hydronium ion can stabilize the intermediate of the hydroxyl radical and further inhibit oxoiron(iv) formation via proton transfer. The contribution of hydroxyl radicals could compete with the oxoiron(iv) species at pH below 2.2. In addition, high-level ab initio calculations question the existence of the iron(iv)-dihydroxo intermediate suggested in the literature. The implications of the computational results for the Fenton oxidation process, cytochrome P450, and catalyst design are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The reaction of iron(ii) and hydrogen peroxide, namely the Fenton reaction, is well-known for its strong oxidizing capability.\"]}"}]}

The Fenton process, one of several advanced oxidation processes, describes the reaction of Fe(II) with hydrogen peroxide. Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) that reacts with hydrogen peroxide to Fe(II) and again initiates the Fenton reaction. In the course of the reactions reactive species, e.g. hydroxyl radicals, are formed. Conditions such as pH, ligand concentrations and the hydrogen peroxide/Fe(II) ratio may influence the OH radical yield. It could be shown that at pH < 2.7 and >3.5 the OH radical yield decreases significantly. Two ligands were investigated, pyrophosphate and sulfate. It was found that pyrophosphate forms a complex with Fe(III) that does not react with hydrogen peroxide and thus, the Fenton reaction is terminated and the OH radical yields do not further increase. The influence of sulfate is not as strong as that of pyrophosphate. The OH radical yield is decreased when sulfate is added but even at higher concentrations the Fenton reaction is not terminated.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The Fenton process, one of several advanced oxidation processes, describes the reaction of Fe(II) with hydrogen peroxide.\"]}"}]}

Effect of O2, Inhibition by Mg(2+), and Oxidation State of Fe. The use of iron ions as catalyst of oxidation with hydrogen peroxide, known as the Fenton reaction, is important for industry and biological systems. It has been widely studied since its discovery in the 19th century, but important aspects of the reaction as which is the oxidant, the role of oxygen, and the oxidation state of Fe still remain unclear. In this work new mechanistic insights of the oxidation of carbohydrates by the Fenton reaction using glycerol as experimental model are described. The reaction was studied by means of oxidation reduction potential (ORP) measures. The stoichiometry was measured, showing the important role of oxygen for lowering H2O2 consumption under aerobic conditions. Evidence is provided to demonstrate that in this system Fe(2+) generates a catalyst by reacting with a substrate to produce a complex, which gives rise to singlet oxygen after reacting with H2O2. This is the first time that the inhibitor effect of Mg(2+) is reported in this reaction, and its participation in the mechanism is described. A rational mechanism for the oxidation of glycerol using the Fenton reaction under these specific conditions is proposed. The role of oxygen, the participation of Fe(2+), and the inhibition by Mg(2+) are fully demonstrated experimentally. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The use of iron ions as catalyst of oxidation with hydrogen peroxide, known as the Fenton reaction, is important for industry and biological systems.\"]}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects.

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms.

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory.

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Infected aneurysm of the abdominal aorta is an uncommon and highly lethal disease, with a >80% rate of death. It is uncommonly associated with spondylodiscitis. Management of this rare association of pathology remains controversial. This report details the case of a patient with a large vascular past history, presenting a scarce association of disease: a ruptured infected aneurysm of the abdominal aorta with a spondylodiscitis due to Gemella haemolysans. The patient recovered quickly and durably, thanks to an unusual cooperation of both vascular surgeons and orthopedists: He underwent an in situ graft replacement and a front vertebral fixation in a single-step surgery. Good immediate and midterm outcome shows a new way of treatment in this rare but severe situation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}
