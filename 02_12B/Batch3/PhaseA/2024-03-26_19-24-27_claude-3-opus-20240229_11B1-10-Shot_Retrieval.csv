However, it's important to note that negation in search queries can be challenging. This query may exclude documents that discuss the lack of association between anemia and chronic kidney failure, as the negation terms would still be present. The ideal results would be documents that discuss anemia and chronic kidney failure but do not mention an association between them.

Depending on the specific use case, it may be better to search for the two concepts separately and then filter out or down-rank results that mention an association.

##

The key components are:

1. Mitapivat and its alternate name AG-348.

2. General terms related to mechanism of action like pharmacodynamics, activity, function, etc. This casts a wide net for potentially relevant information.

3. Terms related to pyruvate kinase (PK or PKR), red blood cells (RBC or erythrocyte), as Mitapivat is known to target the red blood cell form of pyruvate kinase.

4. Terms describing Mitapivat's specific mechanism as an allosteric activator or agonist of pyruvate kinase.

The query aims to find documents that discuss Mitapivat's mechanism of action, specifically its activity as an allosteric activator of red blood cell pyruvate kinase. The synonyms and related terms help capture variations in terminology while still maintaining a focus on the key concepts. Let me know if you would like me to modify or expand the query further.","{'query': {'query_string': {'query': '(""Mitapivat"" OR ""AG-348"") AND (""mechanism of action"" OR ""mode of action"" OR ""pharmacodynamics"" OR ""pharmacology"" OR ""activity"" OR ""function"" OR ""effect"" OR ""how it works"") AND (""pyruvate kinase"" OR ""PK"" OR ""PKR"" OR ""red blood cell"" OR ""erythrocyte"" OR ""RBC"") AND (activator OR agonist OR ""allosteric activator"" OR ""allosteric agonist"")'}}, 'size': 50}",,"['37596712', '31974203', '34987744', '38066891', '37713687', '36847623', '28760888', '37125655', '35366607', '37676741', '35988546', '38066940', '36124781', '35576529', '33822774', '30091852', '36853806', '38066911', '36935283', '37934880', '35417638', '36072510', '37943362', '35964609', '33690814', '36794508', '36698833', '35384026', '34889443']",[],[],[],0.0,0.0,0.0

##

The key components are:
1. Necroptosis and related terms like ""programmed necrosis"" and ""caspase-independent cell death""
2. Cell membrane and synonyms like ""plasma membrane"" and ""cytoplasmic membrane""
3. Terms related to disruption or damage, like disrupt, damage, injure, rupture, permeabilize, ""loss of integrity""

The query uses the AND operator to require all three main concepts to be present. The * wildcard allows for variations in word endings (e.g., disrupt, disrupts, disrupted, disruption).

The query aims to find documents that specifically discuss whether necroptosis involves disruption of cell membranes. It focuses on the key entities and concepts while allowing for some variability in terminology. The double quotes around multi-word phrases ensure they are searched together.

Let me know if you would like me to modify or expand the query further.

##

The key components are:
1. Dermatillomania and its various synonyms, including the medical terms ""excoriation disorder"", ""psychogenic excoriation"", ""neurotic excoriation"", ""acne excoriee"", and the more colloquial ""skin-picking disorder"" and ""skin picking syndrome"". This helps capture the concept regardless of the specific terminology used.

2. Definition-related terms like ""definition"", ""defined"", ""meaning"", ""refers to"", ""is a"", ""is an"", ""is the"". These help hone in on sentences or passages that are likely to provide a definition or explanation of what dermatillomania is.

The query aims to find documents that mention dermatillomania or a synonym in close proximity to language related to providing a definition. The OR operator allows for flexibility in terminology while the AND operator ensures both the disorder and definition concepts are present, promoting relevance and precision.

(""non-hodgkin lymphoma"" OR ""non hodgkin lymphoma"" OR NHL OR ""b-cell lymphoma"" OR ""b cell lymphoma"" OR ""diffuse large b-cell lymphoma"" OR DLBCL OR ""aggressive lymphoma"")
##

The key components are:

1. Glofitamab and its alternate names/codes. This ensures we find documents specifically about this drug.

2. Treatment-related terms like ""treats"", ""used for"", ""indicated for"", etc. This helps find information about what diseases glofitamab is a treatment for.

3. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and related terms. Based on my knowledge, glofitamab is being developed as a treatment for certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Including these disease terms and abbreviations should help retrieve relevant results.

The query aims to find documents that mention glofitamab along with language indicating the diseases it treats, focusing on non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
