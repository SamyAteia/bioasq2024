Cardio-renal-anemia syndrome is a combination of heart failure, kidney failure, and anemia. Many advanced chronic kidney disease patients have both anemia and chronic heart failure. They have often hyperhomocysteinemia, high dimethylarginine values and low erythropoietin levels. Nephrologists treat advanced chronic kidney disease patients with erythropoiesis stimulating agents to improve anemia, renal and heart disease. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents, though considered essential to improve anemia in chronic kidney disease patients, have shown no significant protective effect on cardiovascular disease when used in large clinical trials targeting normal hemoglobin levels. It is possible that the high amounts of these drugs, given to reach normal hemoglobin values, may have counterbalanced the positive effect on endothelium obtained with low doses. Many studies have shown that erythropoietin improves endothelial function in animals with high dimethylarginine levels, lowering asymmetric dimethylarginine and increasing nitric oxide synthesis. Advanced chronic kidney disease patients have also high homocysteine levels which further reduce endothelial function by increasing asymmetric dimethylarginine. Homocysteine-lowering vitamin B treatment has been associated to a significant reduction of cardiovascular disease in advanced chronic kidney disease patients. Low doses of epoetin and B vitamins may improve cardiovascular morbidity by reducing asymmetric dimethylarginine and by increasing nitric oxide synthase activity. This review analyses the interaction between erythropoietin, dimethylarginine and homocysteine, and their role in cardio-renal-anemia syndrome.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Many advanced chronic kidney disease patients have both anemia and chronic heart failure.\"]}"}]}

The treatment measures of malignant carcinomas are most important for human health. In recent years the use of targeted therapy based on small molecule compounds and identical immunoglobulin has been the most frequently used tool to combat cancerous cells. But there are still several limitations in their clinical development and applications, including their ability to bind multiple molecular target sites, both cell surface receptors and intracellular proteins, promoting a greater risk of toxicity. PROTAC is a novel technology that maintains a balance between protein synthesis and degradation and uses molecules instead of conventional enzyme inhibitors, containing two active domains and a linker to destroy unwanted selective protein (like kinase, skeleton protein and regulatory protein). PROTACs are heterobifunctional nano molecules with a size range of about 10 nanometres that eliminate the protein complexes formed by protein-protein interaction through large and flat surfaces generally defined as \"undruggable\" in conventional drug delivery systems, which include around 85% of proteins present in humans, suggesting their wide application in the field of drug development.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies, and 90% of advanced prostate cancer patients relapse after therapy. Trophinin associated protein (TROAP) is essential for centrosome integrity and proper bipolar organisation of spindle assembly during mitosis and plays an essential role in proliferation. We found that TROAP expression correlates with patient survival and speculated that it may be involved in PCa progression. The Oncomine database tool (http://www.oncomine.org) was used to analyse TROAP mRNA expression from microarray data, and patient survival analysis for target genes was performed using the PROGgeneV2 Database (http://watson.compbio.iupui.edu). Gene interference with lentivirus was used to silence TROAP expression in PCa cells and knockdown efficiency was detected by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. Cell viability, colony formation, cell cycle and apoptosis were then assessed to determine the function of TROAP in PCa cells. Markers of cell cycle and apoptosis were tested by western blotting. The correlation between WNT3 or survivin expression and TROAP transcripts in prostate cancer tissues was analysed using GEPIA (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn) and validated by western blotting. The in\u00a0vivo role of TROAP was investigated using xenografts. This protein was overexpressed in PCa, and exhibited relatively higher expression in PCa cell lines, DU145 and 22Rv1. Importantly, analysing human cancer databases available from PROGgeneV2 showed that higher expression of TROAP is associated with shorter overall survival in prostate cancer patients. TROAP knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and led to cell cycle arrest at S phase in 22Rv1 and DU145 cells. Cell cycle arrest resulted in apoptosis in both cell lines via the cyclin A2-cyclin B1-caspase pathway. WNT3 and survivin expression levels were found to correlate with TROAP in PCa, and in\u00a0vivo xenograft assays revealed that silencing of TROAP inhibited PCa tumour growth. Therefore, TROAP might represent a novel predictive marker to guide therapeutic intervention.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Trophinin associated protein (TROAP) is essential for centrosome integrity and proper bipolar organisation of spindle assembly during mitosis and plays an essential role in proliferation.\", \"TROAP regulates prostate cancer progression via the WNT3/survivin signalling pathways.\"]}"}]}

Engagement of programmed death-1 (PD-1) with its two ligands [programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2] has been associated with the suppression of tumor-reactive T cells; however, the underlying mechanism for this T-cell dysfunction is not clear. We hypothesized that PD-1 and PD-L1 signals are, in part, responsible for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) escape from immune antitumor regulation by modulation of the tumor environment. In the present study, we used a multistage model of SCC to examine the role of PD-1/PD-L1 activation during tumor development. Tumor sites presented an increased percentage of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells expressing PD-1 when compared with non-tumorigenic control mice, whereas the expression of PD-L1 was particularly increased in F4/80(+) macrophages in tumor sites. Further, the systemic immune neutralization of PD-1 resulted in a decreased number and delayed incidence rate of papillomas followed by a differential expression of cytokeratins, suggesting that the PD-1-PD-L1 interaction contributes to the progression of SCC by downregulation of antitumor responses. In fact, blocking PD-1 increased the percentage of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells, and the levels of interferon-\u03b3 in the tumor sites.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have led to a paradigm shift in cancer treatment. Understanding the clinical efficacy and safety profile of these drugs is necessary for treatment strategy in clinical practice. To assess the differences between anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 regarding efficacy and safety shown in randomized clinical trials across various tumor types. Systematic searches of PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Embase were conducted from January 1, 2000, to March 1, 2019. In addition, abstracts and presentations from all major conference proceedings were reviewed. All randomized clinical trials that compared anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 with standard treatment in patients with cancer were selected as candidates. Retrospective studies, single-arm phase 1/2 studies, and trials comparing anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 with other immunotherapies were excluded. Studies of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapy were screened and paired by the matching of clinical characteristics as mirror groups. Three investigators independently extracted data from each study following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guideline. Trial names, first author, year of publication, study design, National Clinical Trial identifier number, blinding status, study phase, pathologic characteristics, number of patients, patients' age and sex distribution, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, lines of treatment, study drugs, biomarker status, follow-up time, incidence of adverse events, and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for overall survival and progression-free survival were extracted. A random-effects model was applied for data analysis. Differences in OS between anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 across different cancer types were assessed. An effect size was derived from each mirror group and then pooled across all groups using a random-effects model. Nineteen randomized clinical trials involving 11\u202f379 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, anti-PD-1 exhibited superior overall survival (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65-0.86; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and progression-free survival (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.96; P\u2009=\u2009.02) compared with anti-PD-L1. No significant difference was observed in their safety profiles. Sensitivity analysis presented consistency in the overall estimates across these analyses. Consistent results were observed through frequentist and bayesian approaches with the same studies. Comprehensive analysis suggests that anti-PD-1 exhibited favorable survival outcomes and a safety profile comparable to that of anti-PD-L1, which may provide a useful guide for clinicians.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Importance: Immune checkpoint inhibitors of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have led to a paradigm shift in cance\"]}"}]}

Dermatillomania or skin picking disorder (SPD) is a chronic, recurrent, and treatment resistant neuropsychiatric disorder with an underestimated prevalence that has a concerning negative impact on an individual's health and quality of life. The current treatment strategies focus on behavioral and pharmacological therapies that are not very effective. Thus, the primary objective of this review is to provide an introduction to SPD and discuss its current treatment strategies as well as to propose biomaterial-based physical barrier strategies as a supporting or alternative treatment. To this end, searches were conducted within the PubMed database and Google Scholar, and the results obtained were organized and presented as per the following categories: prevalence, etiology, consequences, diagnostic criteria, and treatment strategies. Furthermore, special attention was provided to alternative treatment strategies and biomaterial-based physical treatment strategies. A total of six products with the potential to be applied as physical barrier strategies in supporting SPD treatment were shortlisted and discussed. The results indicated that SPD is a complex, underestimated, and underemphasized neuropsychiatric disorder that needs heightened attention, especially with regard to its treatment and care. Moreover, the high synergistic potential of biomaterials and nanosystems in this area remains to be explored. Certain strategies that are already being utilized for wound healing can also be further exploited, particularly as far as the prevention of infections is concerned.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Dermatillomania or skin picking disorder (SPD) is a chronic, recurrent, and treatment resistant neuropsychiatric disorder with an underestimated prevalence that has a concerning negative impact on an individual's health and quality of life. \"]}"}]}

Fifty years ago, prescription of the sedative thalidomide caused a worldwide epidemic of multiple birth defects. The drug is now used in the treatment of leprosy and multiple myeloma. However, its use is limited due to its potent teratogenic activity. The mechanism by which thalidomide causes limb malformations and other developmental defects is a long-standing question. Multiple hypotheses exist to explain the molecular mechanism of thalidomide action. Among them, theories involving oxidative stress and anti-angiogenesis have been widely supported. Nevertheless, until recently, the direct target of thalidomide remained elusive. We identified a thalidomide-binding protein, cereblon (CRBN), as a primary target for thalidomide teratogenicity. Our data suggest that thalidomide initiates its teratogenic effects by binding to CRBN and inhibiting its ubiquitin ligase activity. In this review, we summarize the biology of thalidomide, focusing on the molecular mechanisms of its teratogenic effects.

The Cullin-RING ligase 4 E3 ubiquitin ligase component Cereblon (CRBN) is a well-established target for a class of small molecules termed immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). These drugs drive CRBN to modulate the degradation of a number of neosubstrates required for the growth of multiple cancers. Whereas the mechanism underlying the activation of CRBN by IMiDs is well described, the normal physiological regulation of CRBN is poorly understood. We recently showed that CRBN is activated following exposure to Wnt ligands and subsequently mediates the degradation of a subset of physiological substrates. Among the Wnt-dependent substrates of CRBN is Casein kinase 1\u03b1 (CK1\u03b1), a known negative regulator of Wnt signaling. Wnt-mediated degradation of CK1\u03b1 occurs via its association with CRBN at a known IMiD binding pocket. Herein, we demonstrate that a small-molecule CK1\u03b1 agonist, pyrvinium, directly prevents the Wnt-dependent interaction of CRBN with CK1\u03b1, attenuating the consequent CK1\u03b1 degradation. We further show that pyrvinium disrupts the ability of CRBN to interact with CK1\u03b1 at the IMiD binding pocket within the CRBN-CK1\u03b1 complex. Of note, this function of pyrvinium is independent of its previously reported ability to enhance CK1\u03b1 kinase activity. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that pyrvinium attenuates CRBN-induced Wnt pathway activation in\u00a0vivo. Collectively, these results reveal a novel dual mechanism through which pyrvinium inhibits Wnt signaling by both attenuating the CRBN-mediated destabilization of CK1\u03b1 and activating CK1\u03b1 kinase activity.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The Cullin-RING ligase 4 E3 ubiquitin ligase component Cereblon (CRBN) is a well-established target for a class of small molecules termed immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs).\"]}"}]}

Mosunetuzumab is a CD20\u2009\u00d7\u2009CD3 T-cell-engaging bispecific monoclonal antibody that redirects T cells to eliminate malignant B cells. In a phase 1 study, mosunetuzumab was well tolerated and active in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma. We, therefore, aimed to evaluate the safety and anti-tumour activity of fixed-duration mosunetuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who had received two or more previous therapies. We conducted a single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 study at 49 centres in seven countries (Australia, Canada, Germany, South Korea, Spain, UK, and USA). All patients were aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed follicular lymphoma (grade 1-3a) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1. Patients had disease that was relapsed or refractory to two or more previous lines of treatment, including an anti-CD20 therapy and an alkylating agent. Intravenous mosunetuzumab was administered in 21-day cycles with cycle 1 step-up dosing: 1 mg on cycle 1 day 1, 2 mg on cycle 1 day 8, 60 mg on cycle 1 day 15 and cycle 2 day 1, and 30 mg on day 1 of cycle 3 and onwards. Patients with a complete response by investigator assessment using the International Harmonisation Project criteria completed treatment after cycle 8, whereas patients with a partial response or stable disease continued treatment for up to 17 cycles. The primary endpoint was independent review committee-assessed complete response rate (as best response) in all enrolled patients; the primary efficacy analysis compared the observed IRC-assessed complete response rate with a 14% historical control complete response rate in a similar patient population receiving the pan class I PI3K inhibitor copanlisib. Safety was assessed in all enrolled patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02500407, and is ongoing. Between May 2, 2019, and Sept 25, 2020, we enrolled 90 patients. As of the data cutoff date (Aug 27, 2021), the median follow-up was 18\u00b73 months (IQR 13\u00b78-23\u00b73). According to independent review committee assessment, a complete response was recorded in 54 patients (60\u00b70% [95% CI 49\u00b71-70\u00b72]). The observed complete response rate was significantly higher than the historical control complete response rate with copanlisib of 14% (p<0\u00b70001), thereby meeting the primary study endpoint. Cytokine release syndrome was the most common adverse event (40 [44%] of 90 patients) and was predominantly grade 1 (23 [26%] of 90) and grade 2 (15 [17%]), and primarily confined to cycle 1. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia or neutrophil count decreased (24 [27%] of 90 patients), hypophosphataemia (15 [17%]), hyperglycaemia (seven [8%]), and anaemia (seven [8%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 42 (47%) of 90 patients. No treatment-related grade 5 (ie, fatal) adverse event occurred.

For example, ROC curves are rounded when the prediction model included variables with similar effect on disease risk and have an angle when, for example, one binary risk factor has a stronger effect; and ROC curves are stepped rather than smooth when the sample size or incidence is low, when the prediction model is based on a relatively small set of categorical predictors.

Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint that is able to inhibit the immune system by binding to its ligand programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). In many cancer types, among which breast cancer, prognostic and/or predictive values have been suggested for both PD-1 and PD-L1. Previous research has demonstrated discrepancies in PD-L1 expression between primary breast tumors and distant metastases, however data so far have been scarce. We therefore evaluated immunohistochemical expression levels of PD-1 and PD-L1 in primary breast tumors and their paired distant metastases, and evaluated prognostic values. Tissue microarrays from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded resection specimens of primary breast cancers and their matched distant metastases were immunohistochemically stained for PD-1 and PD-L1. PD-1 was available in both primary tumor and metastasis in 82 patients, and PD-L1 in 49 patients. PD-1 was discrepant between primary tumor and metastasis in half of the patients (50%), PD-L1 on tumor cells was discrepant in 28.5%, and PD-L1 on immune cells in 40.8% of the patients. In primary tumors there was a correlation between PD-1 positivity and a higher tumor grade, and between immune PD-L1 and ER negativity. In survival analyses, a significantly better overall survival was observed for patients with PD-L1 negative primary breast tumors that developed PD-L1 positive distant metastases (HR 3.013, CI 1.201-7.561, p\u2009=\u20090.019). To conclude, PD-1 and tumor and immune PD-L1 seem to be discordantly expressed between primary tumors and their matched distant metastases in about one-third to a half of the breast cancer patients. Further, gained expression of PD-L1 in metastases seems to indicate better survival. This illustrates the need of reassessing PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on biopsies of distant metastases to optimize the usefulness of these biomarkers.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint that is able to inhibit the immune system by binding to its ligand programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).\"]}"}]}

Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses.

Anemia resulting from iron and erythropoietin deficiencies is a common complication of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). This article covers major advances in our understanding of anemia in patients with CKD, including newly discovered regulatory molecules, such as hepcidin, to innovative intravenous iron therapies. The use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) in the treatment of anemia has undergone seismic shift in the past 3 years as a result of adverse outcomes associated with targeting higher hemoglobin levels with these agents. Potential mechanisms for adverse outcomes, such as higher mortality, are discussed. Despite the disappointing experience with ESAs, there is a tremendous interest in other novel agents to treat anemia in CKD. Lastly, while awaiting updated guidelines, the authors outline their recommendations on how to best manage patients who are anemic and have CKD.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Anemia resulting from iron and erythropoietin deficiencies is a common complication of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).\", \"nemia in chronic kidney disease\"]}"}]}

Cereblon (CRBN), the molecular target of lenalidomide and pomalidomide, is a substrate receptor of the cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, CRL4(CRBN) . T cell co-stimulation by lenalidomide or pomalidomide is cereblon dependent: however, the CRL4(CRBN) substrates responsible for T cell co-stimulation have yet to be identified. Here we demonstrate that interaction of the transcription factors Ikaros (IKZF1, encoded by the IKZF1 gene) and Aiolos (IKZF3, encoded by the IKZF3 gene) with CRL4(CRBN) is induced by lenalidomide or pomalidomide. Each agent promotes Aiolos and Ikaros binding to CRL4(CRBN) with enhanced ubiquitination leading to cereblon-dependent proteosomal degradation in T lymphocytes. We confirm that Aiolos and Ikaros are transcriptional repressors of interleukin-2 expression. The findings link lenalidomide- or pomalidomide-induced degradation of these transcriptional suppressors to well documented T cell activation. Importantly, Aiolos could serve as a proximal pharmacodynamic marker for lenalidomide and pomalidomide, as healthy human subjects administered lenalidomide demonstrated Aiolos degradation in their peripheral T cells. In conclusion, we present a molecular model in which drug binding to cereblon results in the interaction of Ikaros and Aiolos to CRL4(CRBN) , leading to their ubiquitination, subsequent proteasomal degradation and T cell activation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Cereblon (CRBN), the molecular target of lenalidomide and pomalidomide, is a substrate receptor of the cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, CRL4(C\", \"Cereblon (CRBN), the molecular target of lenalidomide and pomalidomide, is a substrate receptor of the cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, CRL4(CRBN) .\"]}"}]}

End stage renal disease (ESRD) invariably leads to anemia which has been mainly attributed to compromised release of erythropoietin from the defective kidneys with subsequent impairment of erythropoiesis. However, erythropoietin replacement only partially reverses anemia pointing to the involvement of additional mechanisms. As shown more recently, anemia of ESRD is indeed in large part a result of accelerated erythrocyte loss due to suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis, characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine translocation to the cell surface. Phosphatidylserine exposing erythrocytes are bound to and engulfed by macrophages and are thus rapidly cleared from circulating blood. If the loss of erythrocytes cannot be fully compensated by enhanced erythropoiesis, stimulation of eryptosis leads to anemia. Eryptotic erythrocytes may further adhere to the vascular wall and thus impair microcirculation. Stimulators of eryptosis include complement, hyperosmotic shock, energy depletion, oxidative stress, and a wide variety of xenobiotics. Signaling involved in the stimulation of eryptosis includes increase of cytosolic Ca2+ activity, ceramide, caspases, calpain, p38 kinase, protein kinase C, Janus-activated kinase 3, casein kinase 1\u03b1, and cyclin-dependent kinase 4. Eryptosis is inhibited by AMP-activated kinase, p21-activated kinase 2, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, mitogen- and stress-activated kinase MSK1/2, and some illdefined tyrosine kinases. In ESRD eryptosis is stimulated at least in part by a plasma component, as it is triggered by exposure of erythrocytes from healthy individuals to plasma from ESRD patients. Several eryptosis-stimulating uremic toxins have been identified, such as vanadate, acrolein, methylglyoxal, indoxyl sulfate, indole-3-acetic acid and phosphate. Attempts to fully reverse anemia in ESRD with excessive stimulation of erythropoiesis enhances the number of circulating suicidal erythrocytes and bears the risk of interference with micocirculation, At least in theory, anemia in ESRD could preferably be treated with replacement of erythropoietin and additional inhibition of eryptosis thus avoiding eryptosis-induced impairment of microcirculation. A variety of eryptosis inhibitors have been identified, their efficacy in ESRD remains, however, to be shown.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"End stage renal disease (ESRD) invariably leads to anemia which has been mainly attributed to compromised release of erythropoietin from the defective kidneys with subsequent impairment of erythropoiesis.\"]}"}]}

Out of 10,050 publications identified in our database searches, 3 studies were selected: 2 clinical trials and 1 descriptive multicenter study that polled surgeons for their opinion on spa therapy for burn patients. All of the articles concluded that spa therapy is positive in burn scar recovery. No strong study on the effectiveness of spa therapy for burn scars care according to the EPHPP-QAT was identified. Spa therapy in the Saint Gervais spa center appears to be the only spa technique to have been evaluated for burn scar care.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds.

While there have been numerous advances in the field of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) over the last decade, relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) NHL remains a challenge and an area with unmet needs. T-cell redirecting immunotherapeutic approaches including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells and bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) have the potential to revolutionize NHL therapy. BsAbs target CD3 on T-cells and CD19 or CD20 on malignant B-cells and have shown promises as a novel immunotherapy for NHL. The development of CD19 \u00d7 CD3 BsAbs such as blinatumomab was met with significant challenges due to dose-limiting neurologic side effects. However, several CD20 \u00d7 CD3 BsAbs including odronextamab, mosunetuzumab, glofitamab, and epcoritamab emerged recently. They have favorable toxicity profiles, with reduced cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. In addition, all these BsAbs have demonstrated very promising efficacy in R/R NHL. With expansion and registrational studies actively ongoing, approvals of these agents for R/R NHL are anticipated in the near future. Some important questions pertinent to future clinical development of BsAbs include when and how to best utilize BsAbs in the management of R/R NHL, whether there is a role of BsAbs in treatment-na\u00efve NHL, and how to combine BsAbs with other therapies. For example, whether BsAbs can be combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy effectively remains to be seen. A plethora of clinical studies will be needed to help address these questions, some of which are already ongoing. In addition, how do BsAbs compare to CAR T-cell therapy and how to choose and sequence between BsAbs and CAR T-cell therapy need to be addressed. While many of these critical questions remain to be answered in clinical studies, we believe the future of BsAbs in the NHL is very bright.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"However, several CD20 \\u00c3\\u2014 CD3 BsAbs including odronextamab, mosunetuzumab, glofitamab, and epcoritamab emerged recently. \"]}"}]}

Pruritus is a challenging clinical problem which often complicates chronic cholestatic liver disease. For practical purposes, cholestasis may be defined as impaired hepatocellular secretion of bile and is a feature of a wide variety of liver diseases. Cholestasis is usually suspected clinically when a patient presenting with jaundice or pruritus is found to have an elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase activity disproportionate to increases in serum aminotransferase levels. Early imaging by ultrasonography, computerized tomography, or cholangiography is important to address the possibility of remediable biliary tract obstruction. The majority of patients who develop problematic pruritus due to chronic cholestasis will have one of several diseases: primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, drug-induced cholestasis, autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, or alcoholic liver disease. Specific aetiological diagnosis is usually possible when history and physical examination are complemented, as appropriate, by serological testing, hepatobiliary imaging, and liver biopsy. This review does not address issues in diagnosis, but concentrates upon the management of pruritus, a potentially disabling complication of prolonged cholestasis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Cholestasis is usually suspected clinically when a patient presenting with jaundice or pruritus is found to have an elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase activity disproportionate to increases in serum aminotransferase levels.\"]}"}]}

Postpartum depression (PPD) and perinatal mental health care are of growing importance worldwide. Here we aimed to develop and validate machine learning models for the prediction of PPD, and to evaluate the usefulness of the recently adopted 2-week postpartum checkup in some parts of Japan for the identification of women at high risk of PPD. A multicenter retrospective study was conducted using the clinical data of 10\u2009013 women who delivered at \u226535\u2009weeks of gestation at 12 maternity care hospitals in Japan. PPD was defined as an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of \u22659 points at 4\u2009weeks postpartum. We developed prediction models using conventional logistic regression and four machine learning algorithms based on the information that can be routinely collected in daily clinical practice. The model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). In the machine learning models developed using clinical data before discharge, the AUROCs were similar to those in the conventional logistic regression models (AUROC, 0.569-0.630 vs. 0.626). The incorporation of additional 2-week postpartum checkup data into the model significantly improved the predictive performance for PPD compared to that without in the Ridge regression and Elastic net (AUROC, 0.702 vs. 0.630 [p\u2009<\u20090.01] and 0.701 vs. 0.628 [p\u2009<\u20090.01], respectively).

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a life-shortening X-linked genetic disorder characterized by progressive wasting and weakening of muscles in boys. Loss-of-function mutations in the DMD gene, which codes for dystrophin, lead to this disease. The majority of mutations in this gene result in the exclusion of one or more exons from the transcript, eventually causing the remaining exons not to fit together correctly (i.e., out-of-frame mutations). Antisense oligonucleotides, e.g., phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), can induce therapeutic exon skipping during pre-mRNA processing to restore the reading frame of the primary transcript of DMD. As a result, truncated but partially functional dystrophin is produced, potentially slowing down the disease progression. Golodirsen is a provisionally approved PMO-based drug for approx. 8% of all DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping. This article summarizes golodirsen's pharmacology, efficacy and safety information. It also discusses some controversies that golodirsen met after the approval.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Golodirsen is a provisionally approved PMO-based drug for approx. 8% of all DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping. \"]}"}]}

Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, is the target of the immunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of these drugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of 2 common substrates, transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that CC-122, a new chemical entity termed pleiotropic pathway modifier, binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo, and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well as immunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of Aiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes independent of IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u03b3 production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both activated B-cell (ABC) and germinal center B-cell DLBCL cell lines.

This review focuses on several aspects of SFN including etiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria and tests, management, and future perspectives. Diagnostic challenges are discussed, encompassing the role of accurate and standardized assessment of symptoms and signs and providing clues for the clinical practice. The authors discuss the evidence in support of skin biopsy and quantitative sensory testing as diagnostic tests and present an overview of other diagnostic techniques to assess sensory and autonomic fibers dysfunction. The authors also suggest a systematic approach to the etiology including a set of laboratory tests and genetic examinations of sodium channelopathies and other rare conditions that might drive the therapeutic approach based on underlying cause or symptoms treatment.

Kidney failure causes anemia and is associated with a very high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Mildly to moderately decreased kidney function is far more common and also is associated with an elevated prevalence of anemia and CHD risk. Recent data suggest an even higher risk of CHD when both conditions are present. We investigated the association of kidney dysfunction and anemia with CHD events (fatal or nonfatal CHD or coronary revascularization procedures) and CHD and all-cause mortality over 12 years of follow-up in 14971 adults aged 45 to 64 years in the ARIC Study. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated from calibrated serum creatinine using the MDRD Study equation (< 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 excluded, n = 32). Anemia was defined as hemoglobin level < 13.5 g/dL in men (648/6746, 9.6%) and < 12 g/dL in women (1049/8225, 12.8%). The prevalence of anemia was progressively higher at lower estimated GFR < 75 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (both P < .001) for both men and women. A total of 1635 (10.9%) participants had a CHD event, 360 (2.4%) died of CHD, and 1722 (11.5%) died of any cause during follow-up. After adjustment for known risk factors, including diabetes, lipid levels, blood pressure, and use of antihypertensive medication, decreased kidney function was associated with a higher risk of recurrent CHD events and mortality from CHD and all causes. These associations were significantly stronger among participants with anemia. The adjusted relative hazards of all-cause mortality associated with moderately decreased versus normal kidney function (GFR 30-59 vs > or = 90 mL/min per 1.73 m2) were 1.7 (95% CI 1.3-2.2) in the absence of anemia and 3.5 (95% CI 2.4-5.1) in the presence of anemia (P interaction = .001). The combination of moderately decreased kidney function and anemia is associated with an increased risk of CHD events and mortality, emphasizing the need to identify individuals with these conditions and evaluate interventions to treat anemia and slow the progression of chronic kidney disease.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"BACKGROUND: Kidney failure causes anemia and is associated with a very high risk of coronary heart di\"]}"}]}

Cereblon (CRBN) mediates the teratogenic effect of thalidomide in zebrafish, chickens, and humans. It additionally modulates the anti-myeloma effect of the immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide. IMiDs bind to CRBN and recruit neo-substrates for their ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation, which significantly expands the application of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) for targeted drug discovery. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which CRBN mediates the teratogenicity and anti-myeloma effect of IMiDs have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, the normal physiological functions of endogenous CRBN have not been extensively studied, which prevents the thorough assessment of side effects of the CRBN ligand-based PROTACs in the treatment of cancer and neurological diseases. To advance our understanding of the diverse functions of CRBN, in this review, we will survey the ubiquitination-dependent and -independent functions of CRBN, summarize recent advances in the discovery of constitutive substrates and neo-substrates of CRBN, and explore the molecular functions of CRBN in cancer treatment and in the development of neurological diseases.

Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes.

There is, however, a lack of systematic investigation of how different representations could affect the performance of predictive models, especially in the context of machine learning and deep learning. We projected the input diagnoses data in the Cerner HealthFacts database to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and 5 other terminologies, including CCS, CCSR, ICD-9, ICD-10, and PheWAS, and evaluated the prediction performances of these terminologies on 2 different tasks: the risk prediction of heart failure in diabetes patients and the risk prediction of pancreatic cancer.

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibition is associated with antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effects that may be beneficial in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In this phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we investigated the efficacy and safety of BI 1015550, an oral preferential inhibitor of the PDE4B subtype, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive BI 1015550 at a dose of 18 mg twice daily or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the forced vital capacity (FVC) at 12 weeks, which we analyzed with a Bayesian approach separately according to background nonuse or use of an antifibrotic agent. A total of 147 patients were randomly assigned to receive BI 1015550 or placebo. Among patients without background antifibrotic use, the median change in the FVC was 5.7 ml (95% credible interval, -39.1 to 50.5) in the BI 1015550 group and -81.7 ml (95% credible interval, -133.5 to -44.8) in the placebo group (median difference, 88.4 ml; 95% credible interval, 29.5 to 154.2; probability that BI 1015550 was superior to placebo, 0.998). Among patients with background antifibrotic use, the median change in the FVC was 2.7 ml (95% credible interval, -32.8 to 38.2) in the BI 1015550 group and -59.2 ml (95% credible interval, -111.8 to -17.9) in the placebo group (median difference, 62.4 ml; 95% credible interval, 6.3 to 125.5; probability that BI 1015550 was superior to placebo, 0.986). A mixed model with repeated measures analysis provided results that were consistent with those of the Bayesian analysis. The most frequent adverse event was diarrhea. A total of 13 patients discontinued BI 1015550 treatment owing to adverse events. The percentages of patients with serious adverse events or severe adverse events were similar in the two trial groups. In this placebo-controlled trial, treatment with BI 1015550, either alone or with background use of an antifibrotic agent, prevented a decrease in lung function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the prototype of primary humoral immunodeficiencies. Long-term follow-up studies regarding disease-related complications and outcome are scarce. Our aim was to describe the natural history of XLA. A nationwide multicenter study based on the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry was established in 2000 in Italy. Affected patients were enrolled by documenting centers, and the patients' laboratory, clinical, and imaging data were recorded on an annual base. Data on the patients (N\u00a0= 168) were derived from a cumulative follow-up of 1370 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 8.35 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis decreased after establishment of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry (84 months before vs 23 months after). Respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent clinical symptoms at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Regular immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduced the incidence of invasive infections. Affected patients developed chronic lung disease over time (47% after 40 years of follow-up) in the presence of chronic sinusitis (84%). Malignancies were documented in a minority of cases (3.7%). Overall survival for affected patients was significantly reduced when compared with that for the healthy male Italian population, and it further deteriorated in the presence of chronic lung disease. This is the first detailed long-term follow-up study for patients with XLA, revealing that although immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduces the incidence of invasive infections, it does not appear to influence the development of chronic lung disease. The overall survival of affected patients is reduced. Further studies are warranted to improve patients' clinical management and increase awareness among physicians.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) make important contributions to allergic responses via their regulation of degranulation, eicosanoid production, and cytokine expression by mast cells, yet the mechanisms underlying their positive effects on Fc\u03b5RI-dependent signaling are not fully understood. Recently, we reported that mast cell activation and anaphylaxis are negatively regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, little is known about the relationship between ERK1/2-mediated positive and the AMPK-mediated negative regulation of Fc\u03b5RI signaling in mast cells. We investigated possible interactions between ERK1/2 and AMPK in the modulation of mast cell signaling and anaphylaxis. Wild-type or AMPK\u03b12(-/-) mice, or bone marrow-derived mast cells obtained from these mice, were treated with either chemical agents or small interfering RNAs that modulated the activity or expression of ERK1/2 or AMPK to evaluate the functional interplay between ERK1/2 and AMPK in Fc\u03b5RI-dependent signaling. The ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor U0126 and the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-\u03b2-4-ribofuranoside similarly inhibited Fc\u03b5RI-mediated mast cell signals in vitro and anaphylaxis in vivo. ERK1/2-specific small interfering RNA also mimicked this effect on Fc\u03b5RI signals. Moreover, AMPK\u03b12 knockdown or deficiency led to increased Fc\u03b5RI-mediated mast cell activation and anaphylaxis that were insensitive to U0126 or activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-\u03b2-4-ribofuranoside, suggesting that the suppression of Fc\u03b5RI signals by the inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway relies largely on AMPK activation. ERK1/2 controlled AMPK activity by regulating its subcellular translocation. ERK1/2 ablated the AMPK-dependent negative regulatory axis, thereby activating Fc\u03b5RI signals in mast cells.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"ted that mast cell activation and anaphylaxis are negatively regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).

The maximum number of germ cells is present during the fetal life in mammals. Follicular atresia results in rapid depletion of germ cells from the cohort of the ovary. At the time of puberty, only a few hundred (<1%) germ cells are either culminated into oocytes or further get eliminated during the reproductive life. Although apoptosis plays a major role, necrosis as well as necroptosis, might also be involved in germ cell elimination from the mammalian ovary. Both necrosis and necroptosis show similar morphological features and are characterized by an increase in cell volume, cell membrane permeabilization, and rupture that lead to cellular demise. Necroptosis is initiated by tumor necrosis factor and operated through receptor interacting protein kinase as well as mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein. The acetylcholinesterase, cytokines, starvation, and oxidative stress play important roles in necroptosis-mediated granulosa cell death. The granulosa cell necroptosis directly or indirectly induces susceptibility toward necroptotic or apoptotic cell death in oocytes. Indeed, prevention of necrosis and necroptosis pathways using their specific inhibitors could enhance growth/differentiation factor-9 expression, improve survivability as well as the meiotic competency of oocytes, and prevent decline of reproductive potential in several mammalian species and early onset of menopause in women. This study updates the information and focuses on the possible involvement of necrosis and necroptosis in germ cell depletion from the mammalian ovary.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Both necrosis and necroptosis show similar morphological features and are characterized by an increase in cell volume, cell membrane permeabilization, and rupture that lead to cellular demise.\"]}"}]}

Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively.

Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is the latest and perhaps most significant innovation in surgery since Phillipe Mouret of France performed the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1987. This new \"minimum-invasive\" concept that promises scar-free surgery is steadily gathering momentum. It is another milestone in our quest to eliminate surgical trauma, speed patient recovery time and decrease surgical wound-related complications. On 22 July 2005, the Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research (NOSCAR) published a white paper highlighting the barriers to NOTES development, which included the need for appropriate selection of access points, effective closure of the enterotomy site, innovative tools, stable platforms and improved endoscopic orientation. These are just some of the many issues that need to be resolved before the NOTES concept and technique could become a common feature of modern surgery. The publication of the white paper ushered in the beginning of multiple research projects using animal models to test the application of NOTES and its newly developed instruments. The success in animal models was followed by several highly selected successful human trials. National and international surgical innovation departments should now be created where medical industry personnel including inventors, designers and engineers can work together with the medical and surgical providers to address all the limitations affecting NOTES progress.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Reliable measurement of disease progression and the effect of therapeutic interventions in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) require clinically meaningful and scientifically sound rating scales. Therefore, we need robust evidence to support such tools. The North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) is a promising, clinician-rated scale with potential uses spanning clinical practice and clinical trials. In this study, we used Rasch analysis to test its suitability in these roles as a measurement instrument. NSAA data from 191 ambulant boys (mean age at assessment 7 y 8 mo, SD 2 y 4 mo; range 3 y 6 mo-15 y 5 mo) with a confirmed diagnosis of DMD were examined for psychometric properties including clinical meaning, targeting, response categories, model fit, reliability, dependency, stability, and raw to interval-level measurement. All analyses were performed using the Rasch Unidimensional Measurement Model. Overall, Rasch analysis supported the NSAA as being a reliable (high Person Separation Index of 0.91) and valid (good targeting, little misfit, no reversed thresholds) measure of ambulatory function in DMD. One item displayed misfit (lifts head, fit residual 6.9) and there was evidence for some local dependency (stand on right/left leg, climb and descend box step right/left leg, and hop on right/left leg, residual correlations >0.40), which we provide potential solutions for in future use of the NSAA. Importantly, our findings supported good clinical validity in that the hierarchy of items within the scale produced by the analyses was supported by clinical opinion, thus increasing the clinical interpretability of scale scores. In general, Rasch analysis supported the NSAA as a psychometrically robust scale for use in DMD clinical research and trials. This study also demonstrates how Rasch analysis is a useful instrument to detect and understand the key measurement issues of rating scales.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"measurement.

Trophinin-associated protein (TROAP) was a protein first identified to mediate the process of embryo transplantation and later found to be involved in microtubule regulation. However, little is known about the role of TROAP in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we reported that both TROAP mRNA and protein expressions were downregulated in human HCC samples as well as cell lines. A high level of TROAP was associated with small tumor size (p\u2009<\u20090.05), minor tumor nodules (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and mild vein invasion (p\u2009<\u20090.05). We further constructed in vitro TROAP depletion and overexpression HCC cell models. TROAP depletion significantly enhanced the proliferation and colony formation abilities, whereas TROAP overexpression had an inhibitory effect on the growth of HCC cells. The G1/S phase arrest by TROAP overexpression correlated with increased cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27, and declined cell cycle promoting kinase complex CDK6/cyclin D1. Depressed TROAP expression enhanced the migration ability, while the opposite influence was observed in TROAP-overexpressed HCC cells. Taken together, these results indicate that TROAP suppresses cellular growth and migration in HCC. This discovery will further our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of human HCC.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Trophinin-associated protein (TROAP) was a protein first identified to mediate the process of embryo transplantation and later found to be involved in microtubule regulation.\", \"Taken together, these results indicate that TROAP suppresses cellular growth and migration in HCC.\", \"Downregulated Trophinin-Associated Protein Plays a Critical Role in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Through Upregulation of Tumor Cell Growth and Migration.\", \"TROAP depletion significantly enhanced the proliferation and colony formation abilities, whereas TROAP overexpression had an inhibitory effect on the growth of HCC cells.\", \".

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal progressive pediatric muscle disorder and genetically inherited as an X-linked disease that caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. DMD leads to progressive muscle weakness, degeneration, and wasting; finally, follows with the premature demise in affected individuals due to respiratory and/or cardiac failure typically by age of 30. For decades, scientists tried massively to find an effective therapy method, but there is no absolute cure currently for patients with DMD, nevertheless, recent advanced progressions on the treatment of DMD will be hopeful in the future. Several promising gene therapies are currently under investigation. These include gene replacement, exon skipping, suppression of stop codons. More recently, a promising gene editing tool referred to as CRISPR/Cas9 offers exciting perspectives for restoring dystrophin expression in patients with DMD. This review intents to briefly describe these methods and comment on their advances. Since DMD is a genetic disorder, it should be treated by replacing the deficient DMD copy with a functional one. However, there are different types of mutations in this gene, so such therapeutic approaches are highly mutation specific and thus are personalized. Therefore, DMD has arisen as a model of genetic disorder for understanding and overcoming of the challenges of developing personalized genetic medicines, consequently, the lessons learned from these approaches will be applicable to many other disorders. This review provides an update on the recent gene therapies for DMD that aim to compensate for dystrophin deficiency and the related clinical trials.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Several promising gene therapies are currently under investigation.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57).

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, X-linked, fatal, degenerative neuromuscular disease caused by DMD gene mutations. A relationship between exon skipping and dystrophin production in exon 51-amenable patients treated with eteplirsen (EXONDYS 51\u00ae) is established. Once-weekly eteplirsen significantly increased dystrophin, with slower decline in ambulatory function compared to baseline. Long-term treatment with eteplirsen leads to accumulation of dystrophin over time and observed functional benefits in patients with DMD. Compare long-term ambulatory function in eteplirsen-treated patients versus controls. Study 201/202 included 12 eteplirsen-treated patients assessed twice/year for ambulatory function over 4 years. Ambulatory evaluations (6-minute walk test [6MWT], loss of ambulation, and North Star Ambulatory Assessment [NSAA]) were compared with matched controls from Italian Telethon and Leuven registries.

Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is the latest and perhaps most significant innovation in surgery since Phillipe Mouret of France performed the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1987. This new \"minimum-invasive\" concept that promises scar-free surgery is steadily gathering momentum. It is another milestone in our quest to eliminate surgical trauma, speed patient recovery time and decrease surgical wound-related complications. On 22 July 2005, the Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research (NOSCAR) published a white paper highlighting the barriers to NOTES development, which included the need for appropriate selection of access points, effective closure of the enterotomy site, innovative tools, stable platforms and improved endoscopic orientation. These are just some of the many issues that need to be resolved before the NOTES concept and technique could become a common feature of modern surgery. The publication of the white paper ushered in the beginning of multiple research projects using animal models to test the application of NOTES and its newly developed instruments. The success in animal models was followed by several highly selected successful human trials. National and international surgical innovation departments should now be created where medical industry personnel including inventors, designers and engineers can work together with the medical and surgical providers to address all the limitations affecting NOTES progress.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

For half a century, it has been known that the mast cell is the cell responsible for the majority of anaphylactic events. Its mediators, taken as a whole, are capable of producing all of the clinical manifestations of these events. With the discovery of immunoglobulin E (IgE), it was originally felt that the vast majority of anaphylactic episodes were due to antigen coupling with two cell-bound IgE molecules. More recently it has been learned that many episodes are produced by direct activation of mast cells, not involving antigen binding to IgE, and that monomeric IgE under certain conditions can also cause degranulation. Of note--in regard to antigen independent degranulation--are recent reports that the human G-protein-coupled receptor, MRGPRX2, may be the receptor for many drugs and cationic proteins capable of producing direct mast cell degranulation and anaphylactic events.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"For half a century, it has been known that the mast cell is the cell responsible for the majority of anaphylactic events.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57).

In contrast to the traditional mechanism of drug action that relies on the reversible, noncovalent interaction of a ligand with its biological target, a targeted covalent inhibitor (TCI) is designed such that the initial, reversible association is followed by the formation of a covalent bond between an electrophile on the ligand and a nucleophilic center in the protein. Although this approach offers a variety of potential benefits (high potency and extended duration of action), concerns over the possible toxicological consequences of protein haptenization have hindered the development of the TCI concept. Recently, approaches to mitigate the risk of serious adverse reactions to this new class of agent have emerged, thus stimulating interest in the field and leading to authorization of the first cadre of TCIs to be marketed.

Thalidomide, well known for its potent teratogenicity, has been re-evaluated as a clinically effective drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Although the direct target of thalidomide had been unclear until recently, we identified cereblon (CRBN) as a primary direct target of this drug by affinity purification using ferrite glycidyl methacrylate (FG) beads in 2010. CRBN functions as a unique substrate receptor of cullin-RING ligase 4 (CRL4). Various ligands including thalidomide bind to CRBN and alter substrate specificity depending on compound shape, resulting in multiple beneficial effects and/or teratogenicity. Lenalidomide, a thalidomide derivative approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), induces the degradation of onco-proteins such as Ikaros and casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1\u03b1), resulting in anti-cancer effects. Recently, novel CRBN-binding compounds have been developed and their mechanisms of action have been analyzed, including identification of CRBN-related ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2s). Moreover, the 3D structure of several CRBN-ligand-substrate complexes has been determined. Ligands were shown to work as a molecular glue between CRBN and its neosubstrate. In addition, investigators have been recently developing CRBN-based proteolysis-targeting chimeras to achieve degradation of proteins of interest. In this review, the molecular mechanisms of classical and new CRBN-based drugs are described, and recent advances in this field are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Thalidomide, well known for its potent teratogenicity, has been re-evaluated as a clinically effective drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms.

These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is primarily caused by frame-disrupting mutations in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene which abort dystrophin synthesis. We have explored a gene correction therapy aimed at restoration of the reading frame in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Through the binding of antisense oligoribonucleotides to exon-internal sequences in the pre-mRNA, the splicing can be manipulated in such a manner that the targeted exon is skipped and a slightly shorter, but in-frame, transcript is generated. We recently showed that antisense oligoribonucleotide-mediated skipping of exon 46 efficiently induced dystrophin synthesis in cultured muscle cells from Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients carrying an exon 45 deletion. In this study we have identified antisense oligoribonucleotides with which the skipping of 11 other Duchenne muscular dystrophy exons could be induced in cultured human muscle cells. The targeted skipping of only one particular exon may restore the reading frame in a series of patients with different mutations. Accordingly, these antisense oligoribonucleotides would allow correction of over 50% of deletions and 22% of duplications reported in the Leiden DMD-mutation Database.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"We recently showed that antisense oligoribonucleotide-mediated skipping of exon 46 efficiently induced dystrophin synthesis in cultured muscle cells from Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients carrying an exon 45 deletion.\", \"Targeted exon skipping as a potential gene correction therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\", \"rophy gene which abort dystrophin synthesis.

The prognosis of multiple myeloma was quite poor in the last century, but it has significantly improved with the incorporation of novel agents, immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors. Thalidomide was first developed as a sedative in 1950s, but it was withdrawn from the market because of teratogenicity. In 1990s, however, thalidomide received attention due to the discovery of its anticancer potential derived from antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory activities, and its therapeutic effect on myeloma. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of thalidomide under strict control for the treatment of multiple myeloma. After that, two new IMiDs, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, were developed for the sake of more antitumor activity and less adverse events than thalidomide. The molecular mechanism of action of IMiDs remained unclear for a long time until 2010 when the protein cereblon (CRBN) was identified as a primary direct target. IMiDs binds to CRBN and alters the substrate specificity of the CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, resulting in breakdown of intrinsic downstream proteins such as IKZF1 (Ikaros) and IKZF3 (Aiolos). There are many clinical trials of multiple myeloma using IMiDs under various conditions, and most of them show the efficacy of IMiDs. Nowadays lenalidomide plays a central role in both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory settings, mainly in combination with other novel agents such as proteasome inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies.

A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively.

The clinically milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is allelic to DMD. About 33% of all patients are due to de novo mutations and germ line mosaicism is frequently observed.

Male breast cancer is rare, as it represents less than 1% of all breast cancer cases. In addition, male breast cancer appears to have a different biology than female breast cancer. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, programmed death-ligand 1\u00a0(PD-L1), seem to have prognostic and predictive values in a variety of cancers, including female breast cancer. However, the role of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in male breast cancer has not yet been studied. To compare PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in male breast cancer to female breast cancer and to evaluate prognostic values in both groups. Tissue microarrays from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded resection material of 247 female and 164 male breast cancer patients were stained for PD-1 and PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry. PD-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was significantly less frequent in male than in female cancers (48.9 vs. 65.3%, p\u2009=\u20090.002). In contrast, PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells did not differ between the two groups. In male breast cancer, PD-1 and tumor PD-L1 were associated with grade 3 tumors. In female breast cancer, PD-1 and PD-L1 were associated with comparably worse clinicopathological variables. In a survival analysis, no prognostic value was observed for PD-1 and PD-L1 in either male and female breast cancer. In a subgroup analysis, female patients with grade 3/tumor PD-L1-negative or ER-negative/immune PD-L1-negative tumors had worse overall survival. PD-1 seems to be less often expressed in male breast cancer compared to female breast cancer. Although PD-1 and PD-L1 are not definite indicators for good or bad responses, male breast cancer patients may therefore respond differently to checkpoint immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors than female patients.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"ast cancer.

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree.

In recent years, new players involved in P-TEFb-dependent processes have been identified and an important function of CDK9 in coordinating elongation with transcription initiation and termination has been unveiled. As the regulatory functions of CDK9 in gene expression continue to expand, a number of human pathologies, including cancers, have been associated with aberrant CDK9 activity, underscoring the need to properly regulate CDK9.

Slow delayed-rectifier potassium current (IKs) channels, made of the pore-forming KCNQ1 and auxiliary KCNE1 subunits, play a key role in determining action potential duration (APD) in cardiac myocytes. The consequences of drug-induced KCNQ1 splice alteration remain unknown. To study the modulation of KCNQ1 alternative splicing by amiloride and the consequent changes in IKs and action potentials (APs) in ventricular myocytes. Canine endocardial, midmyocardial, and epicardial ventricular myocytes were isolated. Levels of KCNQ1a and KCNQ1b as well as a series of splicing factors were quantified by using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The effect of amiloride-induced changes in the KCNQ1b/total KCNQ1 ratio on AP was measured by using whole-cell patch clamp with and without isoproterenol. With 50 \u03bcmol/L of amiloride for 6 hours, KCNQ1a at transcriptional and translational levels increased in midmyocardial myocytes but decreased in endo- and epicardial myocytes. Likewise, changes in splicing factors in midmyocardial were opposite to that in endo- and epicardial myocytes. In midmyocardial myocytes amiloride shortened APD and decreased isoproterenol-induced early afterdepolarizations significantly. The same amiloride-induced effects were demonstrated by using human ventricular myocyte model for AP simulations under beta-adrenergic stimulation. Moreover, amiloride reduced the transmural dispersion of repolarization in pseudo-electrocardiogram. Amiloride regulates IKs and APs with transmural differences and reduces arrhythmogenicity through the modulation of KCNQ1 splicing. We suggested that the modulation of KCNQ1 splicing may help prevent arrhythmia.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Amiloride regulates IKs and APs with transmural differences and reduces arrhythmogenicity through the modulation of KCNQ1 splicing.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes.

Surprisingly, the results calculated by the RS-MS method remain constant to seven significant figures when the slice thicknesses are changed within a wide range, while those calculated by the C-MS method change significantly. From the mathematical point of view, the C-MS method is only a first order approximation of the RS-MS method. Thus, the calculation precision of the RS-MS method is much higher than that of the C-MS method. Or to achieve the same precision, the slice thickness for the RS-MS method can be taken as two orders of magnitude larger than for the C-MS method in the simulation.

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Cytochrome P450 1A1 is a major enzyme in the bioactivation of exogenous procarcinogens of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the contribution of common genetic variants in CYP1A1 to the HCC risk in Chinese populations has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we examined the association between HCC and four selected tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP1A1, and the risk of CYP1A1 haplotypes/diplotypes in 1006 pathologically confirmed HCC patients and 1015 cancer-free controls, from a Han Chinese population. Haplotypes/diplotypes were constructed from observed genotypes using the Haplo.Stats program. Relative risk was estimated by using multivariable logistic regression method. To summarise, we detected an increased HCC risk in rs4646421 variant carriers (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.61) and rs2198843 variant carriers (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.69), and a reduced risk of HCC (OR 0.70. 95% CI 0.52-0.94) associated with homozygote carriers of rs4886605 variant. These association signals were also observed in non-smokers with rs4646421 (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.16-2.08) and rs4886605 (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.91). Compared to the most common CYP1A1 haplotype CCAG, the haplotype TTGC conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.52). Similarly, the TTGC/TTGC diplotype conferred an increased risk of HCC compared with diplotype CCAG/CCAG (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.23-3.45, P=0.006). Interestingly, the diplotype TTAC/CCAG also conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.22-2.54, P=0.003). Our results suggested that common genetic variants in CYP1A1 may modulate the risk of developing HCC in the study population, particularly in non-smokers. However, our findings need to be validated in at least one independent study of Han Chinese population.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Cell therapy is one of the fastest growing areas in the pharmaceutical industry, with considerable therapeutic potential. However, substantial challenges regarding the utility of these therapies will need to be addressed before they can become mainstream medicines with applicability similar to that of small molecules or monoclonal antibodies. Engineered T cells have achieved success in the treatment of blood cancers, with four chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies now approved for the treatment of B cell malignancies based on their unprecedented efficacy in clinical trials. However, similar results have not yet been achieved in the treatment of the much larger patient population with solid tumours. For cell therapies to become mainstream medicines, they may need to offer transformational clinical effects for patients and be applicable in disease settings that remain unaddressed by simpler approaches. This Perspective provides an industry perspective on the progress achieved by engineered T cell therapies to date and the opportunities and current barriers for accessing broader patient populations, and discusses the solutions and new development strategies required to fully industrialize the therapeutic potential of engineered T cells as medicines.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Engineered T cells have achieved success in the treatment of blood cancers, with four chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies now approved for the treatment of B cell malignancies based on their unprecedented efficacy in clinical trials. \"]}"}]}

Developmental prosopagnosia is a disorder of face recognition that is believed to reflect impairments of visual mechanisms. However, voice recognition has rarely been evaluated in developmental prosopagnosia to clarify if it is modality-specific or part of a multi-modal person recognition syndrome. Our goal was to examine whether voice discrimination and/or recognition are impaired in subjects with developmental prosopagnosia. 73 healthy controls and 12 subjects with developmental prosopagnosia performed a match-to-sample test of voice discrimination and a test of short-term voice\u00a0familiarity, as well as a questionnaire about face and voice identification in daily life. Eleven subjects with developmental prosopagnosia scored within the normal range for voice discrimination and voice recognition. One was impaired on discrimination and borderline for recognition, with equivalent scores for face and voice recognition, despite being unaware of voice processing problems. Most subjects with developmental prosopagnosia are not impaired in short-term voice familiarity, providing evidence that developmental prosopagnosia is usually a modality-specific disorder of face recognition. However, there may be heterogeneity, with a minority having additional voice processing deficits. Objective tests of voice recognition should be integrated into the diagnostic evaluation of this disorder to distinguish it from a multi-modal person recognition syndrome.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"BACKGROUND: Developmental prosopagnosia is a disorder of face recognition that is believed to reflect impairments of visual mechanisms.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant.

Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms.

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The exact etiology is unknown, though PBS predominantly occurs in males. The clinical manifestations can vary widely, from stillbirth to renal and major respiratory dysplasia to almost normal children. The current study included a total of 3 patients.

All patients were diagnosed with congenital aplasia of the abdominal wall and a variety of urogenital malformations. Cryptorchidism and a mega-bladder were observed in 2 patients and distinctive renal malformations, such as renal dysplasia, were observed in 1 patient. Treatment varies but usually includes surgical management of symptoms. One patient required urgent urinary surgery; a vesicotomy was urgently performed due to anuria. These aspects explain the great diversity of opinions on the approach to this syndrome, but the severity of renal dysplasia is the main prognostic factor.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Several programmed lytic and necrotic-like cell death mechanisms have now been uncovered, including the recently described receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3)-mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL)-dependent necroptosis pathway. Genetic experiments have shown that programmed necrosis, including necroptosis, can play a pivotal role in regulating host-resistance against microbial infections. Alternatively, excess or unwarranted necroptosis may be pathological in autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. This review highlights the recent advances in our understanding of the post-translational control of RIPK3-MLKL necroptotic signaling. We discuss the critical function of phosphorylation in the execution of necroptosis, and highlight the emerging regulatory roles for several ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes. Finally, based on current evidence, we discuss the potential mechanisms by which the essential, and possibly terminal, necroptotic effector, MLKL, triggers the disruption of cellular membranes to cause cell lysis. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"chanisms by which the essential, and possibly terminal, necroptotic effector, MLKL, triggers the disruption of cellular membranes to cause cell lysis.\"]}"}]}

This mechanism of action imbues PROTACs with the ability to modulate target biology in unique ways compared to inhibitors, and the development of PROTACs as therapeutic agents is expected to result in new medicines to treat multiple diseases. This review includes published PCT (WO) patent applications covering January 2013 through June 2020.

Delivering on the enormous potential of PROTACs will require the development of PROTAC medicines that are differentiated from traditional small-molecule inhibitors.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Anaphylaxis is a sudden onset, immediate reaction that implies a risk of death. Think of a \"rule of 2s\" for anaphylaxis, which implies that reactions usually begin within 2 minutes to 2 hours after injection, infusion, ingestion, contact, or inhalation. Fatalities can be from asphyxiation from laryngeal or oropharyngeal swelling, collapse from hypotensive shock, cardiac arrest, or acute severe bronchoconstriction that causes respiratory failure and arrest. When there is activation of mast cells and basophils in anaphylaxis, chemical mediators are detectable. The preformed mediators from mast cells include histamine, tryptase, carboxypeptidase A, and proteoglycans (heparin, chondroitin sulfates). Newly synthesized mediators include prostaglandin D\u2082, leukotriene D\u2084, and platelet activating factor. Crucial actions of the mediators include an abrupt increase in vascular permeability, vascular smooth muscle relaxation, and bronchial smooth muscle contraction. Anaphylaxis can be classified into immunologic, nonimmunologic, or idiopathic based on the associated mechanism. For example, immunologic causes of anaphylaxis are those mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies acting through the Fc\u03b5R I (foods, insect venom, 32 \u03b2-lactam antibiotics), whereas non-IgE immunologic anaphylaxis is mediated without the presence of anti-allergen IgE antibodies or ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Idiopathic anaphylaxis involves mast cell activation (acutely elevated urine histamine or serum tryptase) and activated lymphocytes.\", \"When there is activation of mast cells and basophils in anaphylaxis, chemical mediators are detectable.\"]}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Lymphocyte apoptosis and monocyte dysfunction play a pivotal role in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Programmed death-1 (PD1) and its ligand programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) exert inhibitory function by regulating the balance among T cell activation, tolerance, and immunopathology. PD-1 deficiency or blockade has been shown to improve survival in murine sepsis. However, PD-L1 and PD-1 differ in their expression patterns and the role of PD-L1 in sepsis-induced immunosuppression is still unknown. Sepsis was induced in adult C57BL/6 male mice via cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on peripheral T cells, B cells and monocytes were measured 24 hours after CLP or sham surgery. Additionally, the effects of anti-PD-L1 antibody on lymphocyte number, apoptosis of spleen and thymus, activities of caspase-8 and caspase-9, cytokine production, bacterial clearance, and survival were determined. Expression of PD-1 on T cells, B cells and monocytes and PD-L1 on B cells and monocytes were up-regulated in septic animals compared to sham-operated controls. PD-L1 blockade significantly improved survival of CLP mice. Anti-PD-L1 antibody administration prevented sepsis-induced depletion of lymphocytes, increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6 production, decreased IL-10 production, and enhanced bacterial clearance. PD-L1 blockade exerts a protective effect on sepsis at least partly by inhibiting lymphocyte apoptosis and reversing monocyte dysfunction.

Sunlight is attenuated rapidly in the ocean, resulting in little visually useful light reaching deeper than approximately 1000 m in even the clearest water. To maximize sensitivity to the relatively brighter downwelling sunlight, to view the silhouette of animals above them, and to increase the binocular overlap of their eyes, many mesopelagic animals have developed upward-pointing tubular eyes. However, these sacrifice the ability to detect bioluminescent and reflective objects in other directions. Thus, some mesopelagic fish with tubular eyes extend their visual fields laterally and/or ventrally by lensless ocular diverticula, which are thought to provide unfocused images, allowing only simple detection of objects, with little spatial resolution. Here, we show that a medial mirror within the ventrally facing ocular diverticulum of the spookfish, Dolichopteryx longipes, consisting of a multilayer stack derived from a retinal tapetum, is used to reflect light onto a lateral retina. The reflective plates are not orientated parallel to the surface of the mirror. Instead, plate angles change progressively around the mirror, and computer modeling indicates that this provides a well-focused image. This is the first report of an ocular image being formed in a vertebrate eye by a mirror.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Despite oncogenic role of TROAP in various cancers, its function in ccRCC remains to be unraveled. The differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) and miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were obtained by analyzing the related data sets of ccRCC in TCGA. The expression levels of mRNAs and miRNAs in the cell were detected by qRT-PCR, while the protein levels were characterized by western blot. The viability, migratory and invasive abilities of ccRCC cells were determined by MTT, wound healing and cell invasion assays. The combination of miRNA target site prediction and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay verified the binding relationship between miR-532-3p and TROAP. Research on ccRCC displayed that TROAP expression was upregulated, while miR-532-3p was down-regulated. Besides, upregulation of TROAP could accelerate viability, migratory and invasive potentials of ccRCC cells. On the contrary, miR-532-3p could downregulate TROAP level, but TROAP upregulation reversed the viability, migration, and invasion of ccRCC cells. MiR-532-3p could attenuate the viability, migration and invasion of ccRCC cells by targeting TROAP.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, characterized by a poor response to therapy and short survival. To assess the proliferative capacity, we cultured MCL cells, using irradiated 3T6 mouse fibroblasts transfected with human CD40L ('CD40 system') in the presence of different cytokines. Proliferation was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation and by CFSE fluorescence. Thirteen out of 16 MCL cases proliferated well in the CD40 system. In 10 cases a strong response upon further addition of IL-10 was seen, whereas IL-4 had an additional effect in only four cases. CFSE staining of cells before and after culture showed an increased number of cell divisions in the IL-10/CD40L stimulated cells. The MCL cells remained CD5+CD19+. Neither plasma cell differentiation nor isotype switching was seen. The light chain expression was strictly monoclonal. IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, G-CSF and GM-CSF did not stimulate MCL proliferation. IL-10 receptor expression correlated with the response to IL-10 in the culture system and the effect of added IL-10 could be blocked by antibodies directed against IL-10 and the IL-10 receptor. Autocrine IL-10 production by the MCL cells was detected in eight of 10 cases tested. IL-10 receptor blocking decreased proliferation when no exogenous IL-10 was used in four of seven cases tested. EBV assessed by EBER in situ hybridization was not detected in six cases tested. In conclusion, MCL can successfully be cultured upon CD40 stimulation if 3T6 CD40L+ cells are used. In this context IL-10 is a costimulatory factor. IL-10 receptor expression seems to correlate with response to CD40 crosslinking and IL-10.

Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are hetero-bifunctional molecules that could simultaneously bind to the target protein and the E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby leading to selective degradation of the target protein. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and bromodomain 4 (BRD4) are both attractive therapeutic targets in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we developed a small-molecule BRD4 and PLK1 degrader HBL-4 based on PROTAC technology, which leads to fast, efficient, and prolonged degradation of BRD4 and PLK1 in MV4-11\u202fcells tested in\u00a0vitro and vivo, and potent anti-proliferation and BRD4 and PLK1 degradation ability in human acute leukemia MOLM-13 and KG1 cells. Meanwhile, HBL-4 more effectively suppresses c-Myc levels than inhibitor BI2536, resulting in more effective inducing apoptosis activity in MV4-11\u202fcells. At the same time, HBL-4 induced dramatically improved efficacy in the MV4-11 tumor xenograft model as compared with BI2536. This study is, to our knowledge, the first reports about dual PLK1 and BRD4 degraders, which potentially represents an important therapeutic advance in the treatment of cancer.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are hetero-bifunctional molecules that could simultaneously bind to the target protein and the E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby leading to selective degradation of the target protein.\"]}"}]}

Two human epithelial cell lines, trophoblastic teratocarcinoma HT-H and endometrial adenocarcinoma SNG-M cells, adhere to each other at their respective apical cell surfaces in a divalent cation-independent manner. Two novel molecules responsible for the adhesion between these two cell types were identified by expression cDNA cloning. One, named trophinin, is an intrinsic membrane protein and mediates homophilic self-binding. Another, named tastin, is a cytoplasmic protein and is necessary for trophinin to function as a cell adhesion molecule. Trophinin and tastin appear to be associated with the cytoskeleton in HT-H and SNG-M cells. These molecules are normally not expressed in various types of human cells in tissues, with the exception of macrophages. Strong expression of these molecules was detected in the trophectoderm surface of monkey blastocyst.

Cytochrome P450 1A1 is a major enzyme in the bioactivation of exogenous procarcinogens of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the contribution of common genetic variants in CYP1A1 to the HCC risk in Chinese populations has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we examined the association between HCC and four selected tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP1A1, and the risk of CYP1A1 haplotypes/diplotypes in 1006 pathologically confirmed HCC patients and 1015 cancer-free controls, from a Han Chinese population. Haplotypes/diplotypes were constructed from observed genotypes using the Haplo.Stats program. Relative risk was estimated by using multivariable logistic regression method. To summarise, we detected an increased HCC risk in rs4646421 variant carriers (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.61) and rs2198843 variant carriers (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.69), and a reduced risk of HCC (OR 0.70. 95% CI 0.52-0.94) associated with homozygote carriers of rs4886605 variant. These association signals were also observed in non-smokers with rs4646421 (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.16-2.08) and rs4886605 (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.91). Compared to the most common CYP1A1 haplotype CCAG, the haplotype TTGC conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.52). Similarly, the TTGC/TTGC diplotype conferred an increased risk of HCC compared with diplotype CCAG/CCAG (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.23-3.45, P=0.006). Interestingly, the diplotype TTAC/CCAG also conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.22-2.54, P=0.003). Our results suggested that common genetic variants in CYP1A1 may modulate the risk of developing HCC in the study population, particularly in non-smokers. However, our findings need to be validated in at least one independent study of Han Chinese population.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Extensive activation of mast cells is the major switch that triggers systemic anaphylaxis, resulting in the subsequent release of anaphylactic mediators into circulation. We previously demonstrated that rapid changes in oxygen tension lead to mast cell degranulation, and the released tryptase triggers retinal angiogenesis in a murine oxygen-induced retinopathy model. However, whether a rapid shift from hyperoxia to normoxia (relative hypoxic stress) is a risk factor for systemic anaphylaxis remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the relative hypoxia stress induces systemic mast cell activation via transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels, which immediately leads to hypothermia and increased vascular permeability in adult mice. Although mast cell-deficient or TRPA1-deficient mice did not exhibit anaphylactic symptoms following a rapid sift to normoxia, preinjection with bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells (BMCMCs) derived from wild-type TRPA1-expressing mice restored anaphylactic responses. In addition, we found that the rapid reductions in oxygen tension in a culture atmosphere triggered the degranulation of BMCMCs derived from wild-type TRPA1-expressing mice but not that of BMCMCs derived from TRPA1-deficient mice. In human LAD2 mast cells, the relative hypoxic stress led to the degranulation, which was suppressed by the addition of a TRPA1 inhibitor. Gradual reductions from hyperoxia to normoxia led to no anaphylactic symptoms. Our results demonstrated that TRPA1-triggered mast cell degranulation is a novel pathway that induces anaphylactic shock without Ag-Ab reactions. These findings introduce a potential role for oxygen in inducing mast cell-dependent anaphylaxis and highlight the need to reconsider chronic pure oxygen therapy for anoxic diseases.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Extensive activation of mast cells is the major switch that triggers systemic anaphylaxis, resulting in the subsequent release of anaphylactic mediators into circulation.\"]}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The CL microarray platform is a self-contained system for the fully automated multiplexed immunoanalysis: the microarray chip, the fluidic system and the software module enable automated calibration and determination of analyte concentrations during a whole working day. The detection of antibiotics in milk was demonstrated to validate this device. There are few quantitative multi-residue detection methods for routine analysis although the EU has defined maximum residue limits (MRLs) for a number of antibacterial reagents. Therefore, an automated multianalyte detection instrument is needed quantifying simultaneously antibiotics within some minutes. Also regeneration is required to avoid replacing the assay surface. The MCR 3 uses a microarray chip, which consists of two channels for parallel measurement and regeneration. The microarray chip is designed for parallel analysis of up to 13 different antibiotics in milk applying an indirect competitive microarray immunoassay (MIA). Microspotted antibiotics are directly coupled to epoxylated PEG surfaces. As an initial example, penicillin G is quantified in milk on the MCR 3. The penicillin G surface is regenerable for 47 measurement cycles per channel. A limit of detection (LOD) of 1.1 microg/L is achieved by an assay time of 6 min.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Developmental prosopagnosia (DP) is a condition characterised by lifelong face recognition difficulties. Recent neuroimaging findings suggest that DP may be associated with aberrant structure and function in multimodal regions of cortex implicated in the processing of both facial and vocal identity. These findings suggest that both facial and vocal recognition may be impaired in DP. To test this possibility, we compared the performance of 22 DPs and a group of typical controls, on closely matched tasks that assessed famous face and famous voice recognition ability. As expected, the DPs showed severe impairment on the face recognition task, relative to typical controls. In contrast, however, the DPs and controls identified a similar number of voices. Despite evidence of interactions between facial and vocal processing, these findings suggest some degree of dissociation between the two processing pathways, whereby one can be impaired while the other develops typically. A possible explanation for this dissociation in DP could be that the deficit originates in the early perceptual encoding of face structure, rather than at later, post-perceptual stages of face identity processing, which may be more likely to involve interactions with other modalities.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Developmental prosopagnosia (DP) is a condition characterised by lifelong face recognition difficulties.\"]}"}]}

However, this technology is still maturing and the design of PROTACs remains a great challenge. In order to promote the rational design of PROTACs, we present PROTAC-DB, a web-based open-access database that integrates structural information and experimental data of PROTACs. Currently, PROTAC-DB consists of 1662 PROTACs, 202 warheads (small molecules that target the proteins of interest), 65 E3 ligands (small molecules capable of recruiting E3 ligases) and 806 linkers, as well as their chemical structures, biological activities, and physicochemical properties. Except the biological activities of warheads and E3 ligands, PROTAC-DB also provides the degradation capacities, binding affinities and cellular activities for PROTACs. PROTAC-DB can be queried with two general searching approaches: text-based (target name, compound name or ID) and structure-based.

We also explored associations with other variables such as age, functional abilities, and genotype. Using the NorthStar Clinical Network database, 395 patients with >1 NSAA assessment were identified. We utilised latent class trajectory analysis of longitudinal NSAA scores, which produced evidence for at least four clusters of boys sharing similar trajectories versus age in decreasing order of clinical severity: 25% of the boys were in cluster 1 (NSAA falling to \u2264 5 at age ~10y), 35% were in cluster 2 (NSAA \u2264 5 ~12y), 21% in were cluster 3 (NSAA\u2264 5 ~14y), and 19% in cluster 4 (NSAA > 5 up to 15y). Mean ages at diagnosis of DMD were similar across clusters (4.2, 3.9, 4.3, and 4.8y, respectively). However, at the first NSAA assessment, a significant (p<0.05) association was observed between earlier declining clusters and younger age, worse NSAA, slower rise from supine, slower 10 metre walk/run times, and younger age of steroid initiation. In order to assess the probability of observing complete loss of function for individual NSAA items, we examined the proportion of patients who shifted from a score of 1 or 2 at baseline to a score of 0. We also assessed the probability of gain of function using the inverse assessment and stratified the probability of deterioration, improvement-or static behavior-by age ranges and using baseline functional status. Using this tool, our study provides a comprehensive assessment of the NSAA in a large population of patients with DMD and, for the first time, describes discrete clusters of disease progression; this will be invaluable for future DMD clinical trial design and interpretation of findings.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"We hypothesised that boys with DMD could be clustered into groups sharing similar trajectories of ambulatory function over time, as measured by the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score.\", \"Functional variability among boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is well recognised and complicates interpretation of clinical studies.

In chronic kidney disease, anemia and malnutrition coupled with inflammation as malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrom are common and considered as morbidity-mortality factors. The link between these two factors has been described at length in the literature highlighting an association of malnutrition with iron deficiency considered itself as one of the causes of anemia in chronic kidney disease (non-dialysis and hemodialysis). Our study aims to know the prevalence of these two factors in a population of chronic kidney disease (non-dialysis and hemodialysis) of Algiers and to highlight the possible associations between them. This is a multicentre, cross-sectional and descriptive study carried out over a period of 6months (August 2018 to January 2019). Anemia and malnutrition were assessed by various biological and clinical tools such as the malnutrition inflammation score and the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism criteria. Statistical tests were performed on the R studio software, considering P<0.05 as a statistically significant value. Two hundred and nine patients on chronic kidney disease were included (90\u00a0non dialysis and 119\u00a0hemodialysis). The median age was 70 (IQR=16) for non dialysis and 56 (IQR=16.5) for hemodialysis. The prevalence of anemia was 66.66% (n=60) in non dialysis and 70.58% (n=84) in hemodialysis. Absolute iron deficiency anemia was higher in non dialysis (48.33%; n=29) while functional iron deficiency anemia was higher in hemodialysis (34.52%; n=29). The prevalence of malnutrition by malnutrition inflammation score was relatively low. Only functional iron deficiency anemia was associated with malnutrition.

Mitapivat, an oral activator of pyruvate kinase (PK) in red blood cells (RBCs), has shown significant improvements in haemoglobin and haemolysis among patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency who were not receiving regular transfusions. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mitapivat in adults with pyruvate kinase deficiency receiving regular transfusions. ACTIVATE-T was an open-label, single-arm, phase 3 trial conducted in 20 centres across Europe, North America, and Asia. Eligible participants were adults (aged \u226518 years) with a clinical laboratory confirmation of pyruvate kinase deficiency receiving regular transfusions (at least six episodes in the previous year). Participants received oral mitapivat during a 16-week dose-optimisation period (5 mg, 20 mg, 50 mg twice daily) and 24-week fixed-dose period. The primary endpoint was a reduction in transfusion burden (\u226533% reduction in number of RBC units transfused during the fixed-dose period, compared with the participant's individual historical transfusion burden, standardised to 24 weeks). Efficacy and safety were assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of mitapivat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03559699, and is complete. Between June 26, 2018, and Feb 4, 2020, 27 participants (20 [74%] female and seven [26%] male; 20 [74%] White, three [11%] Asian, and four [15%] not reported) were enrolled and received at least one dose of mitapivat. Median duration of exposure to mitapivat was 40\u00b73 weeks (IQR 40\u00b70-41\u00b73). A reduction in transfusion burden by at least 33% was found in ten (37%) participants (95% CI 19-58; p=0\u00b70002). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were increase in alanine aminotransferase (ten [37%] participants), headache (ten [37%]), increase in aspartate aminotransferase (five [19%]), fatigue (five [19%]), and nausea (five [19%]). Two grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events were related to study treatment: joint swelling (one participant [4%]) and an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (one participant [4%]). Three participants had serious treatment-emergent adverse events, none related to the study treatment: increased blood triglycerides, ovarian cyst, and renal colic (each in one participant [4%]). No treatment-related deaths were observed. Mitapivat represents a novel therapy that can reduce transfusion burden in some adults with pyruvate kinase deficiency receiving regular transfusions, and is the first disease-modifying agent approved in this disease.

These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

BACKGROUND Nutcracker syndrome and Wilkie's syndrome are rare vascular diseases due to the abnormal course of the superior mesenteric artery originating from the abdominal aorta with reduced angle (<22\u00b0) and consequent compression of the left renal vein (nutcracker) and duodenum (Wilkie). Here, we report the case of a patient with a rare combination of these 2 syndromes and with unusual clinical manifestation of post-prandial pain. CASE REPORT We describe the case of a young male patient with rapid weight loss, coupled with post-prandial abdominal pain, with sub-acute onset, not associated with other symptoms. The ultrasound examination found an aorto-mesenteric angle of 18\u00b0 and compression of the left renal vein and left varicocele. A CT study was performed to exclude oncological diseases and/or other pathologies responsible for the pain and weight loss, which confirmed the ultrasound findings and showed compression of the third part of the duodenum. The patient underwent endovascular treatment, with stent placement in the left renal vein, which resolved the vascular compression and of the duodenum, with regression of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS The ultrasound scan promptly highlighted the reduction of the aorto-mesenteric angle and the signs of venous congestion of the left renal vein. Based on this experience, in patients with weight loss and post-prandial pain, in our opinion, diagnostic investigations should also be extended to the study of the aorto-mesenteric angle to confirm or exclude any vascular and/or duodenal compression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"BACKGROUND Nutcracker syndrome and Wilkie's syndrome are rare vascular diseases due to the abnormal course of the superior mesenteric artery originating from the abdominal aorta with reduced angle (<22\\u00c2\\u00b0) and consequent compression of the left renal vein (nutcracker) and duodenum (Wilkie). \"]}"}]}

Iron deficiency anemia is a common complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Currently available intravenous (IV) iron replacement therapies have either inconvenient regimens of administration or adverse event profiles that limit their utility in the outpatient setting. Ferumoxytol is a novel, semisynthetic, carbohydrate-coated, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle that is administered IV as an injection. The main objective of this study was to assess the safety of ferumoxytol for the treatment of patients with CKD stages 1 to 5 and 5D. Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, multicenter study of a single 510-mg dose of ferumoxytol versus saline as placebo. 750 patients with CKD stages 1 to 5 and 5D. An IV injection of either 17 mL of ferumoxytol or saline placebo over 17 seconds on day 0 and the alternate agent on day 7. Descriptive comparison of adverse events, laboratory tests, and vital signs. Of 750 randomly assigned patients with CKD, 60% were not on dialysis therapy. 713 patients received ferumoxytol, and 711 received placebo. There were 420 adverse events reported; 242 in 152 patients (21.3%) with ferumoxytol and 178 in 119 patients (16.7%) with placebo. The incidence of related adverse events was 5.2% with ferumoxytol and 4.5% with placebo. The most common related adverse events after each treatment included symptoms related to the injection/infusion site, dizziness, pruritus, headache, fatigue, and nausea. Serious adverse events occurred in 21 patients (2.9%) after ferumoxytol and 13 patients (1.8%) after placebo. Serious related adverse events were observed in 1 patient (0.1%) after each treatment. There was no meaningful decrease in blood pressure after administration of ferumoxytol or placebo. Follow-up was 7 days after each study treatment.

Trichotillomania is defined as an obsessive-compulsive or related disorder in which patients recurrently pull out hair from any region of their body. The disease affects mainly female patients, who often deny the habit, and it usually presents with a bizarre pattern nonscarring patchy alopecia with short hair and a negative pull test. Trichoscopy can reveal the abnormalities resulting from the stretching and fracture of hair shafts, and biopsy can be necessary if the patient or parents have difficulties in accepting the self-inflicted nature of a trichotillomania diagnosis. Trichotillomania requires a comprehensive treatment plan and interdisciplinary approach. Physicians should always have a nonjudgmental, empathic, and inviting attitude toward the patient. Behavioral therapy has been used with success in the treatment of trichotillomania, but not all patients are willing or able to comply with this treatment strategy. Pharmacotherapy can be necessary, especially in adolescents and adult patients. Options include tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glutamate-modulating agents. Glutamate-modulating agents such as N-acetylcysteine are a good first-line option due to significant benefits and low risk of side effects. Physicians must emphasize that the role of psychiatry-dermatology liaison is extremely necessary with concurrent support services for the patient and parents, in case of pediatric patients. In pediatric cases, parents should be advised and thoroughly educated that negative feedback and punishment for hair pulling are not going to produce positive results. Social support is a significant pillar to successful habit reversal training; therefore, physicians must convey the importance of familial support to achieving remission. This is a review article that aims to discuss the literature on trichotillomania, addressing etiology, historical aspects, clinical and trichoscopic features, main variants, differential diagnosis, diagnostic clues, and psychological and pharmacological management.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The disease affects mainly female patients, who often deny the habit, and it usually presents with a bizarre pattern nonscarring patchy alopecia with short hair and a negative pull test. \"]}"}]}

To review and summarize current information regarding the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations associated with anaphylaxis in dogs and cats. The etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis is discussed. Anaphylaxis is a systemic, type I hypersensitivity reaction that often has fatal consequences. Many of the principal clinical manifestations involve organs where mast cell concentrations are highest: the skin, the lungs, and the gastrointestinal tract. Histamine and other deleterious inflammatory mediators promote vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction; they are readily released from sensitized mast cells and basophils challenged with antigen. Anaphylaxis may be triggered by a variety of antigens including insect and reptile venom, a variety of drugs, vaccines, and food. Anaphylaxis is a clinical diagnosis made from a collection of signs and symptoms. It is most commonly based on pattern recognition. Differential diagnoses include severe asthma, pheocromocytoma, and mastocytosis. Epinephrine is considered the drug of choice for the treatment of anaphylaxis. It acts primarily as a vasopressor in improving hemodynamic recovery. Adjunctive treatments include fluid therapy, H1 and H2 antihistamines, corticosteroids, and bronchodilators; however, these do not substitute for epinephrine. Prognosis depends on the severity of the clinical signs. The clinical signs will vary among species and route of exposure. The most severe clinical reactions are associated when the antigen is administered parenterally.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Histamine and other deleterious inflammatory mediators promote vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction; they are readily released from sensitized mast cells and basophils challenged with antigen.

Trophinin-associated protein (TROAP) mediates embryonic transfer, regulates microtubules, and is associated with the biological behavior of various cancers. However, there is limited information on the role of TROAP in glioma. We obtained clinical information on 1948 patients with glioma from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas. Basal assays were used to measure changes in TROAP expression levels in high-grade glioma cell lines and in normal human astrocytes. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays showed that TROAP expression was higher in glioma cell lines than in normal astrocytes. The expression level of TROAP in 749 glioma was significantly higher than that in 228 normal brain tissues using Student's t test. The expression of TROAP has a positive relationship with the clinical characteristics of poor prognosis, such as WHO grade, age and has negatively correlated with the indicators of beneficial prognosis, such as IDH mutation and 1p19q co-deletion. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, single multifactor analysis were used to analyze correlations between TROAP and clinical features and prognosis of gliomas. In addition, TROAP overexpression was an independent risk factor for glioma and was associated with reduced overall survival of patients with glioma particularly in patients with WHO grade III and grade IV glioma. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that homologous recombination, cell cycle, and p53 signaling pathways were enriched in samples overexpressing TROAP.

Anemia, a common complication of chronic kidney disease, usually develops as a consequence of erythropoietin deficiency. Recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa) is indicated for the correction of anemia associated with this condition. However, the optimal level of hemoglobin correction is not defined. In this open-label trial, we studied 1432 patients with chronic kidney disease, 715 of whom were randomly assigned to receive a dose of epoetin alfa targeted to achieve a hemoglobin level of 13.5 g per deciliter and 717 of whom were assigned to receive a dose targeted to achieve a level of 11.3 g per deciliter. The median study duration was 16 months. The primary end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for congestive heart failure (without renal replacement therapy), and stroke. A total of 222 composite events occurred: 125 events in the high-hemoglobin group, as compared with 97 events in the low-hemoglobin group (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.74; P=0.03). There were 65 deaths (29.3%), 101 hospitalizations for congestive heart failure (45.5%), 25 myocardial infarctions (11.3%), and 23 strokes (10.4%). Seven patients (3.2%) were hospitalized for congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction combined, and one patient (0.5%) died after having a stroke. Improvements in the quality of life were similar in the two groups. More patients in the high-hemoglobin group had at least one serious adverse event. The use of a target hemoglobin level of 13.5 g per deciliter (as compared with 11.3 g per deciliter) was associated with increased risk and no incremental improvement in the quality of life.

Necroptosis is a form of regulated cell death which results in loss of plasma membrane integrity, release of intracellular contents, and an associated inflammatory response. We previously found that saturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), which contain \u226520 carbons, accumulate during necroptosis. Here, we show that genetic knockdown of Fatty Acid (FA) Elongase 7 (ELOVL7) reduces accumulation of specific very long chain FAs during necroptosis, resulting in reduced necroptotic cell death and membrane permeabilization.

The efficacy of breast-conserving surgery for the local control of early breast cancer has been repeatedly evidenced. Although immediate reconstruction following breast-conserving surgery has been described, little information is available regarding surgical management in reoperative settings due to positive margins. We studied the influence of intraoperatively assessed and postoperatively controlled surgical margin status on the type of breast-conserving surgery and report our results regarding complications in a reoperative breast reconstruction scenario. All patients were seen by a multidisciplinary team who recommended breast-conserving surgery. According to the breast volume, ptosis and tumor size/location, the patients were also evaluated by a plastic surgeon, who recommended reconstruction with the appropriate technique. Intraoperative assessment of surgical margins was determined by histological examination of frozen sections. The mean follow-up time was 48 months. Two hundred and eighteen patients (88.5%) underwent breast-conserving surgery and immediate reconstruction. Twelve (5.5%) patients had a positive tumor margin after review of the permanent section. All patients underwent re-exploration. In 1.3%, a second reconstructive technique was indicated and in 2.2% a skin-sparing mastectomy with total reconstruction was performed. Our findings support the important role of the intraoperative assessment of surgical margins and its interference in the selection of reconstruction techniques and negative margins; however, it will not guarantee complete excision of the tumor. Success depends on coordinated planning with the oncologic surgeon and careful intraoperative management.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water.

Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is the latest and perhaps most significant innovation in surgery since Phillipe Mouret of France performed the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1987. This new \"minimum-invasive\" concept that promises scar-free surgery is steadily gathering momentum. It is another milestone in our quest to eliminate surgical trauma, speed patient recovery time and decrease surgical wound-related complications. On 22 July 2005, the Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research (NOSCAR) published a white paper highlighting the barriers to NOTES development, which included the need for appropriate selection of access points, effective closure of the enterotomy site, innovative tools, stable platforms and improved endoscopic orientation. These are just some of the many issues that need to be resolved before the NOTES concept and technique could become a common feature of modern surgery. The publication of the white paper ushered in the beginning of multiple research projects using animal models to test the application of NOTES and its newly developed instruments. The success in animal models was followed by several highly selected successful human trials. National and international surgical innovation departments should now be created where medical industry personnel including inventors, designers and engineers can work together with the medical and surgical providers to address all the limitations affecting NOTES progress.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent a new direction in small-molecule therapeutics whereby a heterobifunctional linker to a protein of interest (POI) induces its ubiquitination-based proteolysis by recruiting an E3 ligase. Here, we show that charge reduction, native mass spectrometry, and gas-phase activation methods combine for an in-depth analysis of a PROTAC-linked ternary complex. Electron capture dissociation (ECD) of the intact POI-PROTAC-VCB complex (a trimeric subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase) promotes POI dissociation. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) causes elimination of the nonperipheral PROTAC, producing an intact VCB-POI complex not seen in solution but consistent with PROTAC-induced protein-protein interactions. In addition, we used ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and collisional activation to identify the source of this unexpected dissociation. Together, the evidence shows that this integrated approach can be used to screen for ternary complex formation and PROTAC-protein contacts and may report on PROTAC-induced protein-protein interactions, a characteristic correlated with PROTAC selectivity and efficacy.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent a new direction in small-molecule therapeutics whereby a heterobifunctional linker to a protein of interest (POI) induces its ubiquitination-based proteolysis by recruiting an E3 ligase.\"]}"}]}

Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found.

To determine whether imaging-based risk stratification enables prognostication in diffuse glioma, NOS (not otherwise specified). Data from 220 patients classified as diffuse glioma, NOS, between January 2011 and December 2020 were retrospectively included. Two neuroradiologists analyzed pre-surgical CT and MRI to assign gliomas to the three imaging-based risk types considering well-known imaging phenotypes (e.g., T2/FLAIR mismatch). According to the 2021 World Health Organization classification, the three risk types included (1) low-risk, expecting oligodendroglioma, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant, and 1p/19q-codeleted; (2) intermediate-risk, expecting astrocytoma, IDH-mutant; and (3) high-risk, expecting glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated for each risk type. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis using 10-fold cross-validation with 100-fold bootstrapping was used to compare the performance of an imaging-based survival model with that of a historical molecular-based survival model published in 2015, created using The Cancer Genome Archive data. Prognostication according to the three imaging-based risk types was achieved for both PFS and OS (log-rank test, p < 0.001). The imaging-based survival model showed high prognostic value, with areas under the curves (AUCs) of 0.772 and 0.650 for 1-year PFS and OS, respectively, similar to the historical molecular-based survival model (AUC = 0.74 for PFS and 0.87 for OS). The imaging-based survival model achieved high long-term performance in both 3-year PFS (AUC = 0.806) and 5-year OS (AUC = 0.812).

Iron deficiency anemia is a common complication in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and impairs the therapeutic efficacy of recombinant erythropoietin. Oral or parental iron supplements usually are effective in treating iron deficiency anemia. Some patients, however, respond poorly to iron supplements and are diagnosed as having iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia. The condition exacerbates ESRD but its underlying mechanism was unclear. Hepcidin is a central player in iron homeostasis. It downregulates the iron exporter ferroportin, thereby inhibiting iron absorption, release, and recycling. In ESRD, plasma hepcidin levels are elevated, which contributes to iron deficiency in patients. Matriptase-2, a liver transmembrane serine protease, has been found to have a major role in controlling hepcidin gene expression. In mice, defects in the Tmprss6 gene encoding matriptase-2 result in high hepcidin expression and cause severe microcytic anemia. Similarly, mutations in the human TMPRSS6 gene have been identified in patients with iron-refractory iron deficiency. Thus, matriptase-2 is critical for iron homeostasis and may have an important role in ESRD.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Iron deficiency anemia is a common complication in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and impairs the therapeutic efficacy of recombinant erythropoietin.\"]}"}]}

Dysregulation of alternative splicing (AS) induced by serine/arginine-rich proteins has recently been linked to cancer metastasis. Nonetheless, as a member of the serine/arginine-rich protein family, the involvement of SRSF11 in colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. The TCGA dataset and clinical samples were used to assess SRSF11 expression levels in CRC. For SRSF11, functional experiments were conducted both in vitro and in vivo. RNA-seq technology was used to analyze and screen SRSF11-triggered AS events, which were then confirmed by in vivo UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and mini-gene reporter assays. Jalview software was used to determine the preferential binding motif with relation to exon skipping (ES) events. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and Phospho-tag SDS-PAGE experiments were used to investigate PAK5-mediated phosphorylation regulation on SRSF11, and in vitro kinase experiments validated the interaction. In CRC, SRSF11 was discovered to be overexpressed and associated with a poor prognosis. And SRSF11 played a pro-metastatic role in vitro and in vivo. By screening SRSF11-regulated AS events, we identified the binding motif of SRSF11-triggered splicing-switching of HSPA12A AS, which specifically regulated HSPA12A AS by directly binding to a motif in exon 2. Mechanistically, the HSPA12A transcript with exon 2 retention increased N-cadherin expression by promoting RNA stability. Furthermore, the oncogenic kinase PAK5 phosphorylated SRSF11 at serine 287, protecting it from ubiquitination degradation. SRSF11 exerts pro-metastatic effects in CRC by inhibiting the AS of HSPA12A pre-RNA. Our findings point to SRSF11-regulated HSPA12A splicing as a novel relationship between SRSF11-regulated splicing and CRC metastasis and suggest a PAK5/SRSF11/HSPA12A axis as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in CRC.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Alternative splicing of HSPA12A pre-RNA by SRSF11\", \"SRSF11 exerts pro-metastatic effects in CRC by inhibiting the AS of HSPA12A pre-RNA.

The thymus is critical for central tolerance and diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire development, to provide lifelong defense against pathogens while maintaining self-tolerance. Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Anemia is a common complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and is associated with a reduced quality of life, and an increased morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms involved in anemia associated to CKD are diverse and complex. They include a decrease in endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) production, absolute and/or functional iron deficiency, and inflammation with increased hepcidin levels, among others. Patients are most commonly managed with oral or intravenous iron supplements and with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA). However, these treatments have associated risks, and sometimes are insufficiently effective. Nonetheless, in the last years, there have been some remarkable advances in the treatment of CKD-related anemia, which have raised great expectations. On the one hand, a novel family of drugs has been developed: the hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs). These agents induce, among other effects, an increase in the production of endogenous EPO, improve iron availability and reduce hepcidin levels. Some of them have already received marketing authorization. On the other hand, recent clinical trials have elucidated important aspects of iron supplementation, which may change the treatment targets in the future. This article reviews the current knowledge of the pathophysiology CKD-related anemia, current and future therapies, the trends in patient management and the unmet goals.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"nemia in Chronic Kidney Disease: \", \"nemia is a common complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and is associated with a reduced quality of life,\"]}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Anemia is an adverse outcome and common complication in chronic kidney disease patients. This is usually associated with iron deficiency, inflammation and blood loss. However, little is known about the prevalence of anemia and its predictors among chronic kidney disease patients in Southern Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine anemia and its predictors among adult non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients in Southern Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 384 chronic kidney disease patients from February to April 2019. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected using questionnaires and medical records. Adjusted hemoglobin was taken to define anemia using the level of Hgb <13\u2009mg/dL for males and <12\u2009mg/dL for females; and blood films and serum ferritin were done for anemic participants. SPSS version 25.0 was used for data analysis. Frequency distribution tables and graphs were used to describe descriptive statistics. A bivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the predictors;  Overall prevalence of anemia was 44.0% (95% CI: 39.0%, 48.9%); of which 7.1%, 62.1% and 30.8% of anemic patients had mild, moderate and severe anemia, respectively. The prevalence of anemia increased from 20.6% in stage 2 to 100% in stage 5. Morphologically, normocytic normochromic anemia was the most predominant type. Cardiovascular disease (AOR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.35, 4.16), diabetes mellitus (AOR = 2.77, 95% CI: 1.08, 7.14), stage 3b chronic kidney disease (AOR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.31, 5.73) and stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease patients (AOR = 7.11, 95% CI: 3.22, 15.72) showed significant association with anemia. Anemia was a severe public health problem and associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and stages of chronic kidney disease.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes.

Large deletions were the most frequent type of mutation (72.2%), followed by nonsense mutations (11.9%), exon duplications (8.8%), small deletions (3.0%), splice-site mutations (2.1%), small insertions (1.3%), missense mutations (0.6%), and a combination mutation of a deletion and a duplication (0.1%). Exon 45-50 deletion was the most frequent deletion type, while exon 2 duplication was the most common duplication type. Two deletion hotspots were calculated-one located toward the central part (exon 45-52) of the gene and the other toward the 5'end (exon 8-26). We found no significant difference between hereditary and de novo mutations on deletion hotspots. Nonsense mutations accounted for 62.9% of all small mutations (197 patients). We built a comprehensive national dystrophinopathy mutation database in China, which is essential for basic and clinical research in this field. The mutational spectrum and characteristics of this DMD/BMD group were largely consistent with those in previous international DMD/BMD studies, with some differences. Based on our results, about 12% of DMD/BMD patients with nonsense mutations may benefit from stop codon read-through therapy. Additionally, the top three targets for exon-skipping therapy are exon 51 (141, 13.5%), exon 53 (115, 11.0%), and exon 45 (84, 8.0%).```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"l spectrum.

Lenacapavir (LEN) is a long-acting, highly potent HIV-1 capsid (CA) inhibitor. The evolution of viral variants under the genetic pressure of LEN identified Q67H, N74D, and Q67H/N74D CA substitutions as the main resistance associated mutations (RAMs). Here, we determined high-resolution structures of CA hexamers containing these RAMs in the absence and presence of LEN. Our findings reveal that the Q67H change induces a conformational switch, which adversely affects the inhibitor binding. In the unliganded protein, the His67 side chain adopts the closed conformation by projecting into the inhibitor binding pocket and thereby creating steric hindrance with respect to LEN. Upon the inhibitor binding, the His67 side chain repositions to the open conformation that closely resembles the Gln67 side chain in the WT protein. We propose that the switch from the closed conformation to the open conformation, which is needed to accommodate LEN, accounts for the reduced inhibitor potency with respect to the Q67H CA variant. The N74D CA change results in the loss of a direct hydrogen bond and in induced electrostatic repulsions between CA and LEN. The double Q67H/N74D substitutions exhibited cumulative effects of respective single amino acid changes. An examination of LEN binding kinetics to CA hexamers revealed that Q67H and N74D CA changes adversely influenced the inhibitor binding affinity (```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Structural and Mechanistic Bases of Viral Resistance to HIV-1 Capsid Inhibitor Lenacapavir.\", \"Lenacapavir (LEN) is a long-acting, highly potent HIV-1 capsid (CA) inhibitor. \"]}"}]}

PD-1 plays an important role in T cell exhaustion during HIV infection. PD-1 has two ligands: PD-L1, expressed on hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells, and PD-L2, limited to DCs and macrophages. Little is known about PD-L1 expression and regulation in human macrophages. Previous reports have found few immediate effects of macrophage exposure to HIV, suggesting that macrophages lack PRRs for this virus. Using quantitative confocal microscopy and a multiplexed cytokine bead array, we measured induction of PD-L1, PD-L2, and innate response cytokines in human MDMs in response to chemically inactivated HIV virions. Consistent with previous reports, no cytokines were induced by HIV virion exposure. Whereas PD-L1 and PD-L2 had low baseline expression, TLR ligands (LPS and CL097) up-regulated PD-L1 but not PD-L2. Unlike what we found for cytokine expression, PD-L1 and PD-L2 were up-regulated in response to exposure with inactivated HIV virions or with replication-competent HIV. Expression of PD-L1 was differentially modulated by IL-10, which induced up-regulation of PD-L1 but not of PD-L2, and IL-10 blockade enhanced only PD-L2 expression. We discuss implications for innate recognition of HIV by macrophages and potential, different roles for PD-L1 and PD-L2 in immunity and pathogenesis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"PD-1 has two ligands: PD-L1, expressed on hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells, and PD-L2, limited to DCs and macrophages.\"]}"}]}

A potential model for a newly described heritable human disorder. A new murine mutation, hairpatches (Hpt), is on chromosome 4, 18.1 recombination units distal to brown near the interferon alpha and beta chain structural gene complex. On the inbred HPT/Le strain background, Hpt is semi-dominant, and Hpt/Hpt mice die in utero by 6 to 8 days of gestation. Such death in utero is associated with abnormalities of embryonic ectodermal derivatives. However on the (C57BL/6J x C3HeB/FeJ-a/a) segregating hybrid background, Hpt is a fully dominant mutation. HPT/Le Hpt/+ mice can be recognized by 3 to 4 days of age by patches of lightly pigmented skin. These mice show reduced numbers of hair follicles, abnormalities in hair follicle structure, and patchy absence of hair throughout life. By 2 weeks of age, abnormal hair follicle development is accompanied by thickening of the epidermis, reduction in levels of subcutaneous fat, and dermal inflammation. Progressive glomerulosclerosis, resulting in chronic kidney failure, is accompanied by increases in glomerular mesangial matrix, deposition of immune complexes, and glomerular enlargement. Scanning electron microscopic studies revealed abnormalities of podocytes including disorganization, swelling, and fusion of the foot processes. Increase in serum blood urea nitrogen levels accompanies conspicuous renal histopathologic changes. Cardiovascular changes in Hpt/+ mice are evidenced by hypertrophy of the left heart ventricle. Increased systolic blood pressure in these animals was found by 3 months of age. Anemia occurs in Hpt/+ mice by 40 weeks. The Hpt/+ mutation provides a valuable new animal model for chronic kidney disease accompanied by skin abnormalities and ventricular hypertrophy. The pathologic changes caused by this mutation are similar to those reported in affected family members with a newly described autosomal dominant human disease.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Hairpatches, a single gene mutation characterized by progressive renal disease and alopecia in the mouse.

Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor for the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase 4 (CRL4) complex, is a direct protein target for thalidomide teratogenicity and antitumor activity of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). Here we report that glutamine synthetase (GS) is an endogenous substrate of CRL4(CRBN). Upon exposing cells to high glutamine concentration, GS is acetylated at lysines 11 and 14, yielding a degron that is necessary and sufficient for binding and ubiquitylation by CRL4(CRBN) and degradation by the proteasome. Binding of acetylated degron peptides to CRBN depends on an intact thalidomide-binding pocket but is not competitive with IMiDs. These findings reveal a feedback loop involving CRL4(CRBN) that adjusts GS protein levels in response to glutamine and uncover a new function for lysine acetylation. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor for the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase 4 (CRL4) complex, is a direct protein target for thalidomide teratogenicity and antitumor activity of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs).\"]}"}]}

Rupture of a vulnerable carotid plaque is an important cause of ischemic stroke. Prediction models can support medical decision-making by estimating individual probabilities of future events, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide detailed information on plaque vulnerability. In this review, prediction models for medium to long-term (>90 days) prediction of recurrent ischemic stroke among patients on best medical treatment for carotid stenosis are evaluated, and the emerging role of MRI of the carotid plaque for personalized ischemic stroke prediction is discussed. A systematic search identified two models; the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) medical model, and the Symptomatic Carotid Atheroma Inflammation Lumen stenosis (SCAIL) score. We critically appraised these models by means of criteria derived from the CHARMS (CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modeling Studies) and PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool). We found both models to be at high risk of bias. The ECST model, the most widely used model, was derived from data of large but relatively old trials (1980s and 1990s), not reflecting lower risks of ischemic stroke resulting from improvements in drug treatment (e.g., statins and anti-platelet therapy). The SCAIL model, based on the degree of stenosis and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)-based plaque inflammation, was derived and externally validated in limited samples. Clinical implementation of the SCAIL model can be challenging due to high costs and low accessibility of PET/CT. MRI is a more readily available, lower-cost modality that has been extensively validated to visualize all the hallmarks of plaque vulnerability. The MRI methods to identify the different plaque features are described. Intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), a lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC), and a thin or ruptured fibrous cap (TRFC) on MRI have shown to strongly predict stroke in meta-analyses. To improve personalized risk prediction, carotid plaque features should be included in prediction models. Prediction of stroke in patients with carotid stenosis needs modernization, and carotid MRI has potential in providing strong predictors for that goal.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"We critically appraised these models by means of criteria derived from the CHARMS (CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modeling Studies) and PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool).\"]}"}]}

Lipoprotein-X (Lp-X) is an abnormal low-density lipoprotein frequently found in liver disease. It is regarded as the most sensitive and specific biochemical parameter for the diagnosis of intra- and extrahepatic cholestasis. Moreover, Lp-X is supposed to contribute to the development of hypercholesterolemia in cholestatic liver disease, because it fails to inhibit de novo cholesterol synthesis. This investigation will focus on the relationship between the presence of Lp-X and serum lipid concentrations in cirrhosis. The significance of Lp-X in the diagnosis of cholestasis, compared with alkaline phosphatase (AP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and bilirubin levels, will be assessed as well. The present cross-sectional study includes 212 patients with histopathologically proven cirrhosis. The detection of Lp-X and the quantification of -, beta-, and pre-beta-cholesterol was based on agar gel electrophoresis and polyanion precipitation. For the characterization of liver function, the concentrations of albumin and bilirubin, the activities of liver enzymes, and coagulation times were assessed. In a subgroup of 40 individuals, liver biopsies were re-evaluated to confirm or exclude intrahepatic cholestasis. As a result, there was no association between the appearance of Lp-X and total cholesterol concentrations. While all patients with Lp-X showed intrahepatic cholestasis (predictive value of the positive test = 1), only 16 of 28 patients with cholestasis formed Lp-X (sensitivity = 0.57). The activities of AP and of GGT, as well as the concentrations of bilirubin, were strongly elevated in most patients, with and without cholestasis. The predictive values of AP, GGT, and bilirubin were 0.77, 0.69, and 0.74 for the positive test and 0.5, 0, and 0.6 for the negative test, respectively. We conclude that Lp-X is not related to hypercholesterolemia in cirrhosis. The positive, but not the negative, Lp-X test has high predictive value for the diagnosis of cholestasis in cirrhosis. The biochemical parameters traditionally used for the assessment of extrahepatic cholestasis, AP, GGT, and bilirubin, do not support the diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis caused by cirrhosis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The biochemical parameters traditionally used for the assessment of extrahepatic cholestasis, AP, GGT, and bilirubin, do not support the diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis caused by cirrhosis.\"]}"}]}

Drugs modifying angiotensin II signalling could reduce Alzheimer's disease pathology, thus decreasing the rate of disease progression. We investigated whether the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan, compared with placebo, could reduce brain volume loss, as a measure of disease progression, in clinically diagnosed mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. In this double-blind, multicentre, randomised controlled trial, eligible patients aged 55 years or older, previously untreated with angiotensin II drugs and diagnosed (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria) with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, and who had capacity to consent, were recruited from 23 UK National Health Service hospital trusts. After undergoing a 4-week, open-label phase of active treatment then washout, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) oral over-encapsulated preparations of either 100 mg losartan (after an initial two-dose titration stage) or matched placebo daily for 12 months. Randomisation, minimised by age and baseline medial temporal lobe atrophy score, was undertaken online or via pin-access service by telephone. Participants, their study companions, and study personnel were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome, analysed by the intention-to-treat principle (ie, participants analysed in the group to which they were randomised, without imputation for missing data), was change in whole brain volume between baseline and 12 months, measured using volumetric MRI and determined by boundary shift interval (BSI) analysis. The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Register (ISRCTN93682878) and the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT 2012-003641-15), and is completed. Between July 22, 2014, and May 17, 2018, 261 participants entered the open-label phase. 211 were randomly assigned losartan (n=105) or placebo (n=106). Of 197 (93%) participants who completed the study, 171 (81%) had complete primary outcome data. The mean brain volume (BSI) reduction was 19\u00b71 mL (SD 10\u00b73) in the losartan group and 20\u00b70 mL (10\u00b78) in the placebo group. The difference in total volume reduction between groups was -2\u00b729 mL (95% CI -6\u00b746 to 0\u00b789; p=0\u00b714). The number of adverse events was low (22 in the losartan group and 20 in the placebo group) with no differences between treatment groups. There was one treatment-related death per treatment group. 12 months of treatment with losartan was well tolerated but was not effective in reducing the rate of brain atrophy in individuals with clinically diagnosed mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.

Mantle cell lymphoma is a B cell lymphoproliferative disorder cytogenetically characterized by the t(11;14)(q13;q32) which at molecular level involves the Bcl-1/PRAD-1 gene. Immunophenotypically it is characterized by co-expression of CD5+/CD20+ and CD23- antigens. Histologic patterns are recognized as: diffuse, mantle zone and nodular. Diffuse mantle lymphoma is the most frequent and is associated with a poor prognosis. The rearrangement of the Bcl-1/PRAD-1 increases the synthesis of cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 binds to Cdk4 and forms a complex, then binds to and phosphorylates Rb protein thus triggering cells to progress from G0/G1 to S and thus drives cellular proliferation. The 5-year survival in the MD Anderson series was less than 30% and anthracycline regimens do not appear to have any major impact on the outcomes of cases with nodular or diffuse histopathological patterns.

The most common symptoms before diagnosis were nonspecific: episodic extreme irritability (100 percent), episodic vomiting and lethargy (100 percent), protein avoidance (92 percent), ataxia (77 percent), Stage II coma (46 percent), delayed physical growth (38 percent), developmental delay (38 percent), and seizures (23 percent).

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds.

The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

High-risk patients are currently being evaluated for various catheter-based aortic valve replacement (AVR) techniques. To identify an individual patient's risk, scores such as the EuroSCORE or STS risk calculator (RC) are used. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the surgical results in patients who underwent isolated AVR via a median re-sternotomy after prior CABG. Between 01/96 and 01/08, 349 patients underwent AVR as a redo procedure. One hundred and thirty patients had undergone previous CABG; in 39 patients (29 male, median age 75 (60-84)) preoperative coronary angiography revealed open grafts with no need for additional revascularization (30 had LIMA grafts). These patients underwent isolated AVR. Operative mortality was calculated using the standard and logistic EuroSCORE, and the STS RC. Operative (30-day mortality) was 5% (2 patients). Mean calculated predicted mortality rates for the cohort were: 12+/-3% for the standard, and 32+/-21% for the logistic EuroSCORE, and 10+/-4% according to the STS RC. Receiver operated characteristics (ROC) analysis revealed 100% specificity for standard EuroSCOREs up to 12.5%, logistic EuroSCOREs up to 39.7% and up to 17.45% for STS RC, with a sensitivity of 69.5%, 75% and 97.2%, respectively. The STS RC showed significant better prediction of mortality than the EuroSCOREs (p=0.006).

Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively.

Ruptured and intact plasma membranes are classically considered as hallmarks of necrotic and apoptotic cell death, respectively. As such, apoptosis is usually considered a non-inflammatory process while necrosis triggers inflammation. Recent studies on necroptosis and pyroptosis, two types of programmed necrosis, revealed that plasma membrane rupture is mediated by MLKL channels during necroptosis but depends on non-selective gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores during pyroptosis. Importantly, the morphology of dying cells executed by MLKL channels can be distinguished from that executed by GSDMD pores. Interestingly, it was found recently that secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells, a previously believed non-regulated form of cell lysis that occurs after apoptosis, can be programmed and executed by plasma membrane pore formation like that of pyroptosis. In addition, pyroptosis is associated with pyroptotic bodies, which have some similarities to apoptotic bodies. Therefore, different cell death programs induce distinctive reshuffling processes of the plasma membrane. Given the fact that the nature of released intracellular contents plays a crucial role in dying/dead cell-induced immunogenicity, not only membrane rupture or integrity but also the nature of plasma membrane breakdown would determine the fate of a cell as well as its ability to elicit an immune response.

Anaphylaxis is a sudden-onset, immediate reaction that implies a risk of death. Think of a \"rule of 2's\" for anaphylaxis implying that reactions usually begin within 2 minutes to 2 hours after injection, infusion, ingestion, contact, or inhalation. Fatalities can be from  asphyxiation from laryngeal or oropharyngeal swelling, collapse from hypotensive shock, cardiac arrest, or acute severe bronchoconstriction causing respiratory failure and arrest. When there is activation of mast cells and basophils in anaphylaxis, chemical mediators are detectable. The preformed  mediators from mast cells include histamine, tryptase, carboxypeptidase A, and proteoglycans (heparin and chondroitin sulfates). Newly synthesized mediators include prostaglandin D(2), leukotriene D(4), and platelet-activating factor. Crucial actions of the mediators include  an abrupt increase in vascular permeability, vascular smooth muscle relaxation, and bronchial smooth muscle contraction. Anaphylaxis can be classified into immunologic, nonimmunologic, or idiopathic based on the associated mechanism. For example, immunologic causes of anaphylaxis are those  mediated by IgE antibodies acting through the Fc\u03b5R I (foods, insect venom, and beta-lactam antibiotics) whereas non-IgE immunologic anaphylaxis is mediated without presence of antiallergen IgE antibodies or via Fc\u03b5RI activation (radiographic contrast material). Nonimmunologic  anaphylaxis involves mast cell mediator release such as occurs with exercise, cold temperature exposure, or from medications such as opioids or vancomycin. Idiopathic anaphylaxis involves mast cell activation (acutely elevated urine histamine or serum tryptase) and activated lymphocytes. Because  anaphylaxis is a medical emergency, the drug of choice is epinephrine, not H(1)-receptor antagonists.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" When there is activation of mast cells and basophils in anaphylaxis, chemical mediators are detectable.\"]}"}]}

Experimental evidence demonstrated a crucial role of TROAP (Trophinin-associated protein) in regulating the cell proliferation of multiple tumors, while TROAP expression and function were largely unknown in glioma. We aimed to investigate the oncogenic role of TROAP and its potential mechanisms in gliomagenesis. Four gene expression databases (GEO, TCGA, GTEx and CCLE) were enrolled in our study and used for TROAP expression and survival analysis. TROAP expression was quantified by qRT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry assays in glioma tissues and cell lines. TROAP knockdown and overexpression vector were constructed and transfected into glioma cells. CCK-8, colony formation, transwell, and wound healing assays were used to evaluate cell viability, migration and invasion, flow cytometry to determine cell cycle arrest. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to screen the pathway involved in TROAP-high phenotype. The expression of cell cycle and Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling proteins were analyzed by immunofluorescence and western blot. Based on the bioinformatic analysis and a series of functional assays, we found the TROAP was enriched in glioma tissues and cell lines, its overexpression was correlated with the clinicopathologic characteristics and poor prognosis. TROAP knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and G1/S cell cycle arrest compared with control group in glioma. Mechanism analysis revealed that TROAP activated Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin pathway and upregulated its downstream targets expression, while silencing \u03b2-Catenin or Axin2 could reverse the tumor-promoting effects caused by TROAP, confirming that TROAP-induced malignant phenotype and tumorigenesis via Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling pathway.

Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows.

To compare the real-world safety profile of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitors between younger and older patients. All patients receiving pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab or durvalumab between September 2016 and September 2019 at Haga Teaching Hospital, The Hague, The Netherlands were included in this retrospective study. Immune-related adverse drug reactions (irADRs) were manually retrieved from the electronic patient files. The cumulative incidence of irADRs were compared between younger (<65\u00a0years) and older (\u226565\u00a0years) patients using a Pearsons Chi-square test. We identified 217 patients who were treated with at least one dose of PD-(L)1 inhibitor. 58% were 65\u00a0years or older at the start of immunotherapy. 183 patients (84.3%) received monotherapy PD-(L)1 inhibitors and 34 (15.7%) received chemo-immunotherapy. A total of 278 irADRs were registered. Cutaneous irADRs (53.9%), thyroid gland disorders (20.3%), and non-infectious diarrhoea/colitis (17.5%) were the most frequently reported irADRs. The majority of the irADRs were mild to moderate and no fatal irADRs were observed. 61 (21.9%) of the irADRs needed systemic treatment, of which 19 (6.8%) required treatment with corticosteroids. 18 irADRs (6.5%) were severe and resulted in hospitalisation. The cumulative incidence of cutaneous irADRs was different between the age groups: 45.7% of the patients <65\u00a0years and in 60.0% of the patients \u226565\u00a0years (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036).

A systematic review and meta-analysis. Catamenial pneumothorax CP is a rare form of spontaneous pneumothorax in females forming part of thoracic endometriosis syndrome. Studies have suggested possible benefit from postoperative hormonal administration. As this treatment is inconsistent, we aimed at performing the first meta-analysis to study the efficacy of adding hormonal treatment after surgery to reduce the chances of recurrent catamenial pneumothorax. CENTRAL, MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were systematically searched from inception up to December 15, 2021. Studies reporting five or more patients with end point outcome were included. The main outcome assessed was postoperative recurrence of CP after hormonal manipulation. Baseline, procedural, outcome, and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled with random-effect methods. meta- regression for the effect of patient age and follow up period were tested. Publication bias was examined. This trial was registered with PROSPERO under registration number CRD42022325377. Our electronic search retrieved 644 citations, 48 of which were selected for full-text review. Eleven studies with a combined population of 111 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All patients reached an endpoint of follow up for postoperative recurrence of catamenial pneumothorax after receiving hormonal treatment. Overall study validity was acceptable, with a median score of 6 on the Newcastle Ottawa scale NOS appraising the quality of observational studies. CP is almost always a right-side disease (107/111\u00a0=\u00a096.3\u00a0%). The risk of postoperative recurrence with hormonal treatment was 17.3\u00a0% (8.9 - 25.8\u00a0%) with moderate non-significant heterogeneity (I2\u00a0=\u00a040.85\u00a0%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.076). The cumulative risk of recurrence for all patients not receiving postoperative hormonal therapy included in our study was 54.2\u00a0% (19/35 patients). Meta regression showed age to be a significant predictor of postoperative recurrence (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). As the age increases one year, the risk of recurrence decreases by 6\u00a0% (0.2 - 3\u00a0%). Publication bias was detected by visualizing the funnel plot of standard error, Egger's test with p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and Begg & Mazumdar test with p\u00a0<\u00a00.01. The study included the largest number of CP patients with outcome findings of postoperative recurrence with hormonal treatment despite the small number of studies, non-randomised fashion and publication bias. Our findings recommend the use of hormonal manipulation after thoracic surgical intervention for catamenial pneumothorax unless evident contraindications. Younger patients are at a higher risk of recurrence after surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"OBJECTIVES: Catamenial pneumothorax CP is a rare form of spontaneous pneumothorax in females forming part of thoracic endometriosis syndrome. \"]}"}]}

The class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes;HDAC1,2 and 3 form the catalytic engine of at least seven structurally distinct multiprotein complexes in cells. These molecular machines play a vital role in the regulation of chromatin accessibility and gene activity via the removal of acetyl moieties from lysine residues within histone tails. Their inhibition via small molecule inhibitors has beneficial effects in a number of disease types, including the clinical treatment of hematological cancers. We have previously reported a library of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) incorporating a benzamide-based HDAC ligand (from CI-994), with an alkyl linker and ligand for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase that degrade HDAC1-3 at submicromolar concentrations. Here we report the addition of two novel PROTACs (JPS026 and JPS027), which utilize a ligand for the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family of E3 ligases. We found that both VHL (JPS004)- and IAP (JPS026)-based PROTACs degrade HDAC1-3 and induce histone acetylation to a similar degree. However, JPS026 is significantly more potent at inducing cell death in HCT116 cells than is JPS004. RNA sequencing analysis of PROTAC-treated HCT116 cells showed a distinct gene expression signature in which cell cycle and DNA replication machinery are repressed. Components of the mTORC1 and -2 complexes were also reduced, leading to an increase in FOXO3 and downstream target genes that regulate autophagy and apoptosis. In summary, a novel combination of HDAC and IAP ligands generates a PROTAC with a potent ability to stimulate apoptosis and differential gene expression in human cancer cells.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"We have previously reported a library of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) incorporating a benzamide-based HDAC ligand (from CI-994), with an alkyl linker and ligand for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase that degrade HDAC1-3 at submicromolar concentrations.\"]}"}]}

Anemia is common and associated with adverse outcomes in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Many factors contribute to declining hemoglobin as CKD progresses, but impaired production of erythropoietin by failing kidneys is a central cause. Hepcidin-mediated iron restriction also contributes to anemia by downregulating both intestinal iron absorption and release of stored iron for erythropoiesis. The core components of anemia management remain erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) and iron supplementation, but despite these therapies, a substantial number of children remain anemic. Although escalating ESA dose to target higher hemoglobin has been associated with adverse outcomes in adults, no trials have investigated this association in children, and maintaining hemoglobin levels in a narrow range with conservative ESA dosing is challenging. Judicious use of iron supplementation can enhance the response to ESAs, but the iron storage markers most commonly used in clinical practice have limitations in distinguishing which patients will benefit most from additional iron. Several novel anemia therapies, including hypoxia-inducible factor stabilizers, prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, and dialysate-delivered iron supplements, have been developed and may offer options for alternative anemia management.

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Laboratory testing is an important target for high-value care initiatives, constituting the highest volume of medical procedures. Prior studies have found that up to half of all inpatient laboratory tests may be medically unnecessary, but a systematic method to identify these unnecessary tests in individual cases is lacking. To systematically identify low-yield inpatient laboratory testing through personalized predictions. In this retrospective diagnostic study with multivariable prediction models, 116\u202f637 inpatients treated at Stanford University Hospital from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2017, a total of 60\u202f929 inpatients treated at University of Michigan from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018, and 13\u202f940 inpatients treated at the University of California, San Francisco from January 1 to December 31, 2018, were assessed. Diagnostic accuracy measures, including sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive values (NPVs), positive predictive values (PPVs), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), of machine learning models when predicting whether inpatient laboratory tests yield a normal result as defined by local laboratory reference ranges. In the recent data sets (July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2017) from Stanford University Hospital (including 22\u202f664 female inpatients with a mean [SD] age of 58.8 [19.0] years and 22\u202f016 male inpatients with a mean [SD] age of 59.0 [18.1] years), among the top 20 highest-volume tests, 792\u202f397 were repeats of orders within 24 hours, including tests that are physiologically unlikely to yield new information that quickly (eg, white blood cell differential, glycated hemoglobin, and serum albumin level).

These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

The cytokine interleukin-6 is involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Olokizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 cytokine directly, is being tested for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In a 24-week, phase 3, multicenter, placebo- and active-controlled trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:2:2:1 ratio) patients with rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to methotrexate to receive subcutaneous olokizumab at a dose of 64 mg every 2 or 4 weeks, adalimumab (40 mg every 2 weeks), or placebo; all patients continued methotrexate therapy. The primary end point was an American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response (\u226520% fewer tender and swollen joints and \u226520% improvement in three of five other domains) at week 12, with each olokizumab dose tested for superiority to placebo. We also tested the noninferiority of each olokizumab dose to adalimumab with respect to the percentage of patients with an ACR20 response (noninferiority margin, -12 percentage points in the lower boundary of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference between groups). A total of 464 patients were assigned to receive olokizumab every 2 weeks, 479 to receive olokizumab every 4 weeks, 462 to receive adalimumab, and 243 to receive placebo. An ACR20 response at week 12 occurred in 44.4% of the patients receiving placebo, in 70.3% receiving olokizumab every 2 weeks (difference vs. placebo, 25.9 percentage points; 97.5% confidence interval [CI], 17.1 to 34.1), in 71.4% receiving olokizumab every 4 weeks (difference vs. placebo, 27.0 percentage points; 97.5% CI, 18.3 to 35.2), and in 66.9% receiving adalimumab (difference vs. placebo, 22.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 14.8 to 29.8) (P<0.001 for the superiority of each olokizumab dose to placebo). Both olokizumab doses were noninferior to adalimumab with respect to the percentage of patients with an ACR20 response at week 12 (difference, 3.4 percentage points [97.5% CI, -3.5 to 10.2] with olokizumab every 2 weeks and 4.5 percentage points [97.5% CI, -2.2 to 11.2] with olokizumab every 4 weeks). Adverse events, most commonly infections, occurred in approximately 70% of the patients who received olokizumab. Antibodies against olokizumab were detected in 3.8% of the patients receiving the drug every 2 weeks and in 5.1% of those receiving it every 4 weeks. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were receiving maintenance methotrexate, olokizumab was superior to placebo and noninferior to adalimumab in producing an ACR20 response at 12 weeks.

Cellular proteins CPSF6, NUP153 and SEC24C play crucial roles in HIV-1 infection. While weak interactions of short phenylalanine-glycine (FG) containing peptides with isolated capsid hexamers have been characterized, how these cellular factors functionally engage with biologically relevant mature HIV-1 capsid lattices is unknown. Here we show that prion-like low complexity regions (LCRs) enable avid CPSF6, NUP153 and SEC24C binding to capsid lattices. Structural studies revealed that multivalent CPSF6 assembly is mediated by LCR-LCR interactions, which are templated by binding of CPSF6 FG peptides to a subset of hydrophobic capsid pockets positioned along adjoining hexamers. In infected cells, avid CPSF6 LCR-mediated binding to HIV-1 cores is essential for functional virus-host interactions. The investigational drug lenacapavir accesses unoccupied hydrophobic pockets in the complex to potently impair HIV-1 inside the nucleus without displacing the tightly bound cellular cofactor from virus cores. These results establish previously undescribed mechanisms of virus-host interactions and antiviral action.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The investigational drug lenacapavir accesses unoccupied hydrophobic pockets in the complex to potently impair HIV-1 inside the nucleus without displacing the tightly bound cellular cofactor from virus cores. \"]}"}]}

Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. Use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) has been a mainstay of treatment since 1990. A series of large trials demonstrated that ESAs have serious safety problems, including increasing cardiovascular and thrombotic events, and death. Analyses suggest high pharmacologic doses of ESAs, rather than the highly achieved hemoglobin, may mediate harm. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activators stimulate endogenous erythropoietin production and enhance iron availability. In early clinical trials, these oral agents appear to be capable of replacing ESA therapy and minimizing the need for i.v. iron therapy for chronic kidney disease-related anemia, while having other potentially advantageous actions. Large phase 3 trials are underway with several HIF activators. This commentary reviews trends in anemia management, the safety issues related to our present therapies, the role of HIF in regulating erythropoiesis, and the diverse actions of HIF activators.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"options for the anemia of chronic kidney disease.\", \"nemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease\"]}"}]}

The identification of people at risk of cognitive impairment is essential for improving recruitment in secondary prevention trials of Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to test and qualify a biomarker risk assignment algorithm (BRAA) to identify participants at risk of developing mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease within 5 years, and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of low-dose pioglitazone to delay onset of mild cognitive impairment in these at-risk participants. In this phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, we enrolled cognitively healthy, community living participants aged 65-83 years from 57 academic affiliated and private research clinics in Australia, Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. By use of the BRAA, participants were grouped as high risk or low risk. Participants at high risk were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive oral pioglitazone (0\u00b78 mg/day sustained release) or placebo, and all low-risk participants received placebo. Study investigators, site staff, sponsor personnel, and study participants were masked to genotype, risk assignment, and treatment assignment. The planned study duration was the time to accumulate 202 events of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease in White participants who were at high risk (the population on whom the genetic analyses that informed the BRAA development was done). Primary endpoints were time-to-event comparisons between participants at high risk and low risk given placebo (for the BRAA objective), and between participants at high risk given pioglitazone or placebo (for the efficacy objective). The primary analysis included all participants who were randomly assigned, received at least one dose of study drug, and had at least one valid post-baseline visit, with significance set at p=0\u00b701. The safety analysis included all participants who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study medication. An efficacy futility analysis was planned for when approximately 33% of the anticipated events occurred in the high-risk, White, non-Hispanic or Latino group. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01931566. Between Aug 28, 2013, and Dec 21, 2015, we enrolled 3494 participants (3061 at high risk and 433 at low risk). Of those participants, 1545 were randomly assigned to pioglitazone and 1516 to placebo. 1104 participants discontinued treatment (464 assigned to the pioglitazone group, 501 in the placebo high risk group, and 139 in the placebo low risk group). 3399 participants had at least one dose of study drug or placebo and at least one post-baseline follow-up visit, and were included in the efficacy analysis. 3465 participants were included in the safety analysis (1531 assigned to the pioglitazone group, 1507 in the placebo high risk group, and 427 in the placebo low risk group). In the full analysis set, 46 (3\u00b73%) of 1406 participants at high risk given placebo had mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, versus four (1\u00b70%) of 402 participants at low risk given placebo (hazard ratio 3\u00b726, 99% CI 0\u00b785-12\u00b745; p=0\u00b7023). 39 (2\u00b77%) of 1430 participants at high risk given pioglitazone had mild cognitive impairment, versus 46 (3\u00b73%) of 1406 participants at high risk given placebo (hazard ratio 0\u00b780, 99% CI 0\u00b745-1\u00b740; p=0\u00b7307). In the safety analysis set, seven (0\u00b75%) of 1531 participants at high risk given pioglitazone died versus 21 (1\u00b74%) of 1507 participants at high risk given placebo. There were no other notable differences in adverse events between groups. The study was terminated in January, 2018, after failing to meet the non-futility threshold. Pioglitazone did not delay the onset of mild cognitive impairment. The biomarker algorithm demonstrated a 3 times enrichment of events in the high risk placebo group compared with the low risk placebo group, but did not reach the pre-specified significance threshold. Because we did not complete the study as planned, findings can only be considered exploratory. The conduct of this study could prove useful to future clinical development strategies for Alzheimer's disease prevention studies.

Iron deficiency anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD patients suffer from both absolute and functional iron deficiency. Absolute iron deficiency is defined by severely reduced or absent iron stores, while functional iron deficiency is defined by adequate iron stores but insufficient iron availability for incorporation into erythroid precursors. This is due to increased levels of hepcidin. Anemia in CKD is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The association between anemia and mortality may be related to the severity of anemia. All CKD patients should be screened for anemia during the initial evaluation for CKD. Criteria used to define iron deficiency are different among CKD compared to normal renal function. Among CKD patients, absolute iron deficiency is defined when the transferrin saturation (TSAT) is \u226420% and the serum ferritin concentration is \u2264100 ng/mL among predialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients or \u2264200 ng/mL among hemodialysis patients. Functional iron deficiency, also known as iron-restricted erythropoiesis, is characterized by TSAT \u226420% and elevated ferritin levels. Iron supplementation is recommended for all CKD patients with anemia. There is general agreement according to guidelines that intravenous (i.v.) iron supplementation is the preferred method for CKD patients on dialysis (CKD stage 5D) and either i.v. or oral iron is recommended for patients with CKD ND (CKD stages 3-5).

Insects and fungi share a long history of association in various habitats, including the wood-decomposition niche. Fungal mimicry of termite eggs is one of the most striking evolutionary consequences of insect-fungus association. Termites of the genus Reticulitermes often harbor fungal sclerotia, called \"termite balls,\" along with eggs in nursery chambers, whereby the fungus gains a competitor-free habitat in termite nests. Sophisticated morphological and chemical camouflage are needed for the fungus to mimic termite eggs. However, the mechanism of chemical egg mimicry by the fungus is unknown. Here, we show that the fungus mimics termite eggs chemically by producing the cellulose-digesting enzyme beta-glucosidase. We found that the termite egg-recognition pheromone consists of beta-glucosidase and lysozyme. Both enzymes are major salivary compounds in termites and are also produced in termite eggs. Termite balls were tended by termites only when the fungus produced beta-glucosidase. Our results demonstrated that the overlap of the cellulose digestion niche between termites and the fungus sharing the same chemicals provided the opportunity for the origin of termite egg mimicry by the fungus. This suggests that pheromone compounds might have originally evolved within other life history contexts, only later gaining function in chemical communication.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is the most frequent pregnancy-specific liver disease.

Despite good maternal prognosis, elevated bile acid concentration in maternal blood is an influencing factor to advers fetal outcome. The ICP is associated with increased rates of preterm birth, neonatal unit admission and stillbirth. This is the result of acute fetal asphyxia as opposed to a chronic uteroplacental insufficiency. Reliable monitoring or predictive tools (e.g. cardiotocography (CTG) or ultrasound) that help to prevent advers events are yet to be explored.

Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a lifelong genodermatosis associated with blistering, wounding, and scarring caused by mutations in COL7A1, the gene encoding the anchoring fibril component, collagen VII (C7). Here, we evaluated beremagene geperpavec (B-VEC), an engineered, non-replicating COL7A1 containing herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) vector, to treat RDEB skin. B-VEC restored C7 expression in RDEB keratinocytes, fibroblasts, RDEB mice and human RDEB xenografts. Subsequently, a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 clinical trial (NCT03536143) evaluated matched wounds from nine RDEB patients receiving topical B-VEC or placebo repeatedly over 12\u2009weeks. No grade 2 or above B-VEC-related adverse events or vector shedding or tissue-bound skin immunoreactants were noted. HSV-1 and C7 antibodies sometimes presented at baseline or increased after B-VEC treatment without an apparent impact on safety or efficacy. Primary and secondary objectives of C7 expression, anchoring fibril assembly, wound surface area reduction, duration of wound closure, and time to wound closure following B-VEC treatment were met. A patient-reported pain-severity secondary outcome was not assessed given the small proportion of wounds treated. A global assessment secondary endpoint was not pursued due to redundancy with regard to other endpoints. These studies show that B-VEC is an easily administered, safely tolerated, topical molecular corrective therapy promoting wound healing in patients with RDEB.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a lifelong genodermatosis associated with blistering, wounding, and scarring caused by mutations in COL7A1, the gene encoding the anchoring fibril component, collagen VII (C7).

The first patient suffered from corticotroph pituitary carcinoma and the second from metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma. They were both treated with KTZ for tumor-associated hypercortisolism. Hepatic function was normal on KTZ prior to initiation of PD-1 inhibitors, after which they rapidly developed severe hepatic dysfunction. In both cases, liver biopsy was consistent with drug-induced hepatic injury. Liver function fully recovered on discontinuing KTZ and the PD-1 inhibitors along with methylprednisone therapy. Antifungal azole therapy is commonly used in oncology patients who may be co-treated with PD-1 inhibitors.

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

This work presents an update on the management of iron deficiency in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), either with or without anaemia. A review is made of the recommendations of the guidelines for the treatment of iron deficiency in CKD. It also presents new studies on iron deficiency in patients with CKD, as well as new findings about iron therapy and its impact on clinical outcomes. Anaemia is a common complication of CRF, and is associated with a decrease in the quality of life of the patients, as well as an increase in morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency (absolute or functional) is common in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients, and may cause anaemia or a low response to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. For this reason, the clinical guidelines for the treatment of the anaemia in Nephrology indicate the correction of the deficiency in the presence of anaemia. Iron replacement therapy is indicated in patients with CKD and anaemia (Hb\u00a0<\u00a012\u00a0g/dl) in accordance with the guidelines. There is no unanimity in the indication of iron replacement therapy in patients with Hb\u00a0>\u00a012\u00a0g/dl, regardless of whether they have an absolute or functional iron deficiency. Intravenous iron replacement therapy is safe, more efficient and rapid than oral therapy for achieving an increase haemoglobin lels and reducing the dose of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. For the administration of intravenous iron in non-dialysis chronic renal failure patients a strategy of high doses and low frequency would be preferred on being more convenient for the patient, preserves better the venous capital, and is safe and cost-effective. Iron plays an essential role in energy metabolism and other body functions beyond the synthesis of haemoglobin, for which the iron deficiency, even in the absence of anaemia, could have harmful effects in patients with CKD. The correction of the iron deficiency, in the absence of anaemia is associated with functional improvement in patients with heart failure, and in muscle function or fatigue in patients without CKD. Despite the evidence of benefits in the correction of iron deficiency in patients with CKD, more studies are required to evaluate the impact of the correction of the iron deficiency in the absence of anaemia on morbidity and mortality, quality of life and physical capacity, as well as the long-term effect of oral and intravenous iron replacement therapy in this population.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" iron deficiency in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), either with or without anaemia. \"]}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms.

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can lead to serious and potentially lethal adverse events. In recent years, several drugs have been withdrawn from the market due to interaction-related adverse events (AEs). Current methods for detecting DDIs rely on the accumulation of sufficient clinical evidence in the post-market stage - a lengthy process that often takes years, during which time numerous patients may suffer from the adverse effects of the DDI. Detection methods are further hindered by the extremely large combinatoric space of possible drug-drug-AE combinations. There is therefore a practical need for predictive tools that can identify potential DDIs years in advance, enabling drug safety professionals to better prioritize their limited investigative resources and take appropriate regulatory action. To meet this need, we describe Predictive Pharmacointeraction Networks (PPINs) - a novel approach that predicts unknown DDIs by exploiting the network structure of all known DDIs, together with other intrinsic and taxonomic properties of drugs and AEs. We constructed an 856-drug DDI network from a 2009 snapshot of a widely-used drug safety database, and used it to develop PPIN models for predicting future DDIs. We compared the DDIs predicted based solely on these 2009 data, with newly reported DDIs that appeared in a 2012 snapshot of the same database. Using a standard multivariate approach to combine predictors, the PPIN model achieved an AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.81 with a sensitivity of 48% given a specificity of 90%. An analysis of DDIs by severity level revealed that the model was most effective for predicting \"contraindicated\" DDIs (AUROC\u200a=\u200a0.92) and less effective for \"minor\" DDIs (AUROC\u200a=\u200a0.63). These results indicate that network based methods can be useful for predicting unknown drug-drug interactions.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Using a standard multivariate approach to combine predictors, the PPIN model achieved an AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.81 with a sensitivity of 48% given a specificity of 90%.\"]}"}]}

With rising cost pressures on health care systems, machine-learning (ML)-based algorithms are increasingly used to predict health care costs. Despite their potential advantages, the successful implementation of these methods could be undermined by biases introduced in the design, conduct, or analysis of studies seeking to develop and/or validate ML models. The utility of such models may also be negatively affected by poor reporting of these studies. In this systematic review, we aim to evaluate the reporting quality, methodological characteristics, and risk of bias of ML-based prediction models for individual-level health care spending. We will systematically search PubMed and Embase to identify studies developing, updating, or validating ML-based models to predict an individual's health care spending for any medical condition, over any time period, and in any setting. We will exclude prediction models of aggregate-level health care spending, models used to infer causality, models using radiomics or speech parameters, models of non-clinically validated predictors (e.g., genomics), and cost-effectiveness analyses without predicting individual-level health care spending. We will extract data based on the Checklist for\u00a0Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modeling Studies (CHARMS), previously published research, and relevant recommendations. We will assess the adherence of ML-based studies to the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement and examine the inclusion of transparency and reproducibility indicators (e.g. statements on data sharing). To assess the risk of bias, we will apply the Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Findings will be stratified by study design, ML methods used, population characteristics, and medical field. Our systematic review will appraise the quality, reporting, and risk of bias of ML-based models for individualized health care cost prediction.

Anemia is a major problem in patients with chronic kidney insufficiency. The development of recombinant human erythropoietin has enabled physicians to correct this anemia. Although anemia has not been considered to be a common or important contributor to congestive heart failure, anemia of any cause can lead to cardiac damage and eventually congestive heart failure. Our joint renal-cardiac heart failure team found that anemia was indeed very common in congestive heart failure and was associated with severe, medication-resistant cardiac failure. Correction of the anemia with erythropoietin and intravenous iron led to a marked improvement in patients' functional status and their cardiac function, and to a marked fall in the need for hospitalization and for high-dose diuretics; renal function usually improved or at least stabilized. Subsequent investigations by others have confirmed many of our observations. We call this interrelationship between congestive heart failure, chronic kidney insufficiency, and anemia the Cardio-Renal Anemia syndrome.

These patients require a thorough evaluation to identify and correct causes of anemia other than erythropoietin deficiency. The mainstay of treatment of anemia secondary to CKD has become erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). The use of ESAs does carry risks and these agents need to be used judiciously.

The microarray chip reader (MCR 3) is designed as a stand-alone platform, with the goal to quantify multiple analytes in complex matrices of food and liquid samples for field analysis or for routine analytical laboratories. The CL microarray platform is a self-contained system for the fully automated multiplexed immunoanalysis: the microarray chip, the fluidic system and the software module enable automated calibration and determination of analyte concentrations during a whole working day. The detection of antibiotics in milk was demonstrated to validate this device. There are few quantitative multi-residue detection methods for routine analysis although the EU has defined maximum residue limits (MRLs) for a number of antibacterial reagents. Therefore, an automated multianalyte detection instrument is needed quantifying simultaneously antibiotics within some minutes. Also regeneration is required to avoid replacing the assay surface. The MCR 3 uses a microarray chip, which consists of two channels for parallel measurement and regeneration. The microarray chip is designed for parallel analysis of up to 13 different antibiotics in milk applying an indirect competitive microarray immunoassay (MIA). Microspotted antibiotics are directly coupled to epoxylated PEG surfaces. As an initial example, penicillin G is quantified in milk on the MCR 3.

Prune belly syndrome (PBS), also known as Eagle-Barrett syndrome, is a rare congenital disorder characterized by absence or hypoplasia of the abdominal wall musculature, urinary tract anomalies, and cryptorchidism in males. The etiology of PBS is largely unresolved, but genetic factors are implicated given its recurrence in families. We examined cases of PBS to identify novel pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs). A total of 34 cases (30 males and 4 females) with PBS identified from all live births in New York State (1998-2005) were genotyped using Illumina HumanOmni2.5 microarrays. CNVs were prioritized if they were absent from in-house controls, encompassed \u226510 consecutive probes, were \u226520\u00a0Kb in size, had \u226420% overlap with common variants in population reference controls, and had \u226420% overlap with any variant previously detected in other birth defect phenotypes screened in our laboratory. We identified 17 candidate autosomal CNVs; 10 cases each had one CNV and four cases each had two CNVs. The CNVs included a 158\u00a0Kb duplication at 4q22 that overlaps the BMPR1B gene; duplications of different sizes carried by two cases in the intron of STIM1 gene; a 67\u00a0Kb duplication 202\u00a0Kb downstream of the NOG gene, and a 1.34\u00a0Mb deletion including the MYOCD gene.

To explore the genetic basis for a Chinese patient suspected for Canavan disease. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried out for the proband, and candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing of the proband, her parents and brother. Prenatal diagnosis was provided to her mother by chorionic villi sampling (CVS) upon her subsequent pregnancy. The proband, a 4-month-old female infant, had manifested drowsiness, hypotonia and apathy. Urine metabolism screening showed elevated N-acetylaspartic acid. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormal myelination and multiple abnormal signals in large brain areas. WES revealed that the proband has harbored compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene, namely c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) in exon 1 and c.634+1G>A (P.?) in exon 4. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) and c.634+1G>A (p.?) variants were respectively inherited from her mother and father. Her phenotypically normal brother has carried a heterozygous c.634+1G>A (p.?) variant. Prenatal diagnosis by CVS indicated that the fetus was a heterozygous carrier of the c.187A>G variant. WES can facilitate the diagnosis of Canavan disease, particularly for those lacking specific phenotypes of the disease. The compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene probably underlay the Canavan disease in this patient, and the result has enabled prenatal diagnosis for this family.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene probably underlay the Canavan disease in this patient, and the result has enabled prenatal diagnosis for this family.\"]}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of brain tumors did not use molecular abnormalities as diagnostic criteria. Studies have shown that genotyping allows a better prognostic classification of diffuse glioma with improved treatment selection. This has resulted in a major revision of the WHO classification, which is now for adult diffuse glioma centered around isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and 1p/19q diagnostics. This revised classification is reviewed with a focus on adult brain tumors, and includes a recommendation of genes of which routine testing is clinically useful. Apart from assessment of IDH mutational status including sequencing of R132H-immunohistochemistry negative cases and testing for 1p/19q, several other markers can be considered for routine testing, including assessment of copy number alterations of chromosome 7 and 10 and of TERT promoter, BRAF, and H3F3A mutations. For \"glioblastoma, IDH mutated\" the term \"astrocytoma grade IV\" could be considered. It should be considered to treat IDH wild-type grades II and III diffuse glioma with polysomy of chromosome 7 and loss of 10q as glioblastoma. New developments must be more quickly translated into further revised diagnostic categories. Quality control and rapid integration of molecular findings into the final diagnosis and the communication of the final diagnosis to clinicians require systematic attention.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"This has resulted in a major revision of the WHO classification, which is now for adult diffuse glioma centered around isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and 1p/19q diagnostics.\"]}"}]}

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), anemia, and declining kidney function are recognized as risk factors for adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure. This analysis was conducted to evaluate whether anemia is a risk factor for kidney function decrease in patients with heart failure. Data from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), a randomized trial of enalapril versus placebo in patients with ejection fractions <or=35%, were analyzed. After randomization, creatinine measurements were taken at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 4 months, and every 4 months thereafter. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) equation, and GFR slope was calculated. \"Rapid decrease\" was defined as a decrease in the GFR of >or=6 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/year. Anemia was defined as baseline hematocrit <36%. Multivariate logistic regression weighted by the number of GFR assessments was used to test the relation between anemia and rapid decrease. We also evaluated whether CKD (baseline GFR </=60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) modified the relation between anemia and rapid decrease. In the 6,360 subjects, the mean age was 59 years, 31% had CKD, and 6% had anemia. Median follow-up was 2 years. In multivariate analysis, anemia was associated with a 1.30 increased odds (95% confidence interval 1.18 to 1.45) of rapid decrease in GFR. In subjects with CKD, anemia was associated with a 1.71 increased odds (95% confidence interval 1.43 to 2.05) of rapid decrease, while in subjects without CKD, anemia was associated with a 1.16 increased odds (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.31) of rapid decrease (p for interaction <0.001).

Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is a peripheral nervous system disease due to affection of A-delta or C-fibers in a proximal, distal, or diffuse distribution. Selective SFN (without large fiber affection) manifests with pain, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Though uniform diagnostic criteria are unavailable, most of them request typical clinical features and reduced intra-epidermal nerve fiber density on proximal or distal skin biopsy. Little consensus has been reached about the treatment of SFN, why this narrative review aims at summarizing and discussing treatment options for SFN. Treatment of SFN can be classified as symptomatic, pathophysiologic, or causal. Prerequisites for treating SFN are an established diagnosis, knowledge about the symptoms and signs, and the etiology. Pain usually responds to oral/intravenous pain killers, antidepressants, anti-seizure drugs, or topical, transdermal specifications. Some of the autonomic disturbances respond favorably to symptomatic treatment. SFN related to Fabry disease or hATTR are accessible to pathogenesis-related therapy. Immune-mediated SFN responds to immunosuppression or immune-modulation. Several of the secondary SFNs respond to causal treatment of the underlying disorder. In conclusion, treatment of SFN relies on a multimodal concept and includes causative, pathophysiologic, and symptomatic measures. It strongly depends on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and etiology, why it is crucial before initiation of treatment to fix the diagnosis and etiology. Due to the heterogeneous clinical presentation and multi-causality, treatment of SFN should be individualized with the goal of controlling the underlying cause, alleviating pain, and optimizing functionality.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" Selective SFN (without large fiber affection) manifests with pain, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction.

The North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) tool is a key instrument for measuring clinical outcomes in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). To gain a better understanding of the longitudinal utility of the NSAA, we evaluated NSAA data from a phase II trial of 120 patients with DMD treated with domagrozumab or placebo. The NSAA exploratory analyses included assessment of individual skills gained/lost, total skills gained/lost, cumulative loss of function, and the impact of transient loss of function due to a temporary disability on NSAA total score (temporary zero score). There was no significant difference in the total number of NSAA skills gained (mean 1.41 and 1.04, respectively; p = 0.3314) or lost (3.90 vs. 5.0; p = 0.0998) between domagrozumab- vs. placebo-treated patients at week 49. However, domagrozumab-treated patients were less likely to lose the ability to perform a NSAA item (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65-0.98, p = 0.029) over 48-weeks vs. placebo-treated patients. When temporary zero scores were changed to \"not obtainable\" (8 values from 7 patients), domagrozumab-treated patients scored higher on the NSAA total score versus placebo-treated patients (difference at week 49: 2.0, 95% CI: 0.1-3.9, p = 0.0359). These exploratory analyses reveal additional approaches to interpreting the NSAA data beyond just change in NSAA total score.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57).

However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms.

Probing microarray assays in the presence of a hybridization mix retrieves precious information on hybridization kinetics. However, in common detection schemes, useful surface signals compete with the high supernatant background from labelled targets in the mix. A known solution consists in exciting specifically the microarray surface with evanescent fields. Configurations using planar optical waveguides to produce such fields are shown here to present also a dramatic excitation irradiance enhancement at the guide/surrounding matter interface. We compare theoretically and experimentally a guided excitation with a classical external excitation. A full electromagnetic analysis predicts an irradiance increase higher than 10(4) for adequately tailored waveguides. We deposited high-index TiO(2) sol-gel waveguides on glass substrates according to best simulations. Quantitative enhancement analysis exploiting actual biological fluorescent spots perfectly confirms the irradiance amplification effect of a thin waveguide. The impact of amplification on the design of biochip readers is discussed since it leaves ample margin for simple and low-cost light couplers, advantageous in affordable readers and sensor systems.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Splice-modulation therapy, whereby molecular manipulation of premessenger RNA splicing is engineered to yield genetic correction, is a promising novel therapy for genetic diseases of muscle and nerve-the prototypical example being Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common childhood genetic disease, affecting one in 3500 newborn boys, causing progressive muscle weakness, heart and respiratory failure and premature death. No cure exists for this disease and a number of promising new molecular therapies are being intensively studied. Duchenne muscular dystrophy arises due to mutations that disrupt the open-reading-frame in the DMD gene leading to the absence of the essential muscle protein dystrophin. Of all novel molecular interventions currently being investigated for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, perhaps the most promising method aiming to restore dystrophin expression to diseased cells is known as 'exon skipping' or splice-modulation, whereby antisense oligonucleotides eliminate the deleterious effects of DMD mutations by modulating dystrophin pre-messenger RNA splicing, such that functional dystrophin protein is produced. Recently this method was shown to be promising and safe in clinical trials both in The Netherlands and the UK. These trials studied direct antisense oligonucleotide injections into single peripheral lower limb muscles, whereas a viable therapy will need antisense oligonucleotides to be delivered systemically to all muscles, most critically to the heart, and ultimately to all other affected tissues including brain. There has also been considerable progress in understanding how such splice-correction methods could be applied to the treatment of related neuromuscular diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy and myotonic dystrophy, where defects of splicing or alternative splicing are closely related to the disease mechanism.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Of all novel molecular interventions currently being investigated for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, perhaps the most promising method aiming to restore dystrophin expression to diseased cells is known as 'exon skipping' or splice-modulation, whereby antisense oligonucleotides eliminate the deleterious effects of DMD mutations by modulating dystrophin pre-messenger RNA splicing, such that functional dystrophin protein is produced.\"]}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

We followed the CHARMS recommendations (Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies), extracting the information from its 11 domains (Source of data, Participants, etc). We determined the risk of bias and applicability (participants, outcome, predictors and analysis) through PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool). A total of 14 studies were included. In the CHARMS extraction, the models found showed great variability in its 11 domains. Regarding the PROBAST checklist, only one article had an unclear risk of bias as it did not indicate how missing data were handled while the others all had a high risk of bias. This was mainly due to the statistical analysis (inadequate sample size, handling of continuous predictors, missing data and selection of predictors), since 13 studies had a high risk of bias. Applicability was satisfactory in six articles. Most of the models integrate predictors from routine clinical practice. Discrimination and calibration were assessed for almost all the models, with the area under the ROC curve ranging from 0.59 to 0.955 and no lack of calibration. Only three models were externally validated and their maximum discrimination values in the derivation were from 0.712 and 0.84. One of them (Osborn) had undergone multiple validation studies.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57).

The objective of this study was to develop and externally validate a model to predict adjunctive vasopressin response in patients with septic shock being treated with norepinephrine for bedside use in the intensive care unit. This was a retrospective analysis of two adult tertiary intensive care unit septic shock populations. Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJH) from 2010 to 2017 and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) from 2001 to 2012. Two septic shock populations (548 BJH patients and 464 BIDMC patients) that received vasopressin as second-line vasopressor. Patients who were vasopressin responsive were compared with those who were nonresponsive. Vasopressin response was defined as survival with at least a 20% decrease in maximum daily norepinephrine requirements by one calendar day after vasopressin initiation, without a third-line vasopressor. Two supervised machine learning models (gradient-boosting machine [XGBoost] and elastic net penalized logistic regression [EN]) were trained in 1000 bootstrap replications of the BJH data and externally validated in the BIDMC data to predict vasopressin responsiveness. Vasopressin responsiveness was similar among each cohort (BJH 45% and BIDMC 39%). Mortality was lower for vasopressin responders compared with nonresponders in the BJH (51% vs. 73%) and BIDMC (45% vs. 83%) cohorts, respectively. Both models demonstrated modest discrimination in the training (XGBoost area under receiver operator curve [AUROC] 0.61 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.61], EN 0.59 [95% CI 0.58-0.59]) and external validation (XGBoost 0.68 [95% CI 0.63-0.73], EN 0.64 [95% CI 0.59-0.69]) datasets. Vasopressin nonresponsiveness is common and associated with increased mortality. The models' modest performances highlight the complexity of septic shock and indicate that more research will be required before clinical decision support tools can aid in anticipating patient-specific responsiveness to vasopressin.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"area under receiver operator curve [AUROC] \"]}"}]}

The membrane surface of mast cells from human heart tissue of patients undergoing cardiac transplantation expresses the high affinity receptors for IgE (FcepsilonRI) and C5a receptors. Activation of HHMCs in vitro with anti-IgE or anti-FcepsilonRI induced the release of preformed mediators (histamine, tryptase and chymase) and the de novo synthesis of LTC4 (approximately equal to 18 ng/10(6) cells) and PGD2 (approximately equal to 18 ng/10(6) cells). Complement activation and anaphylatoxin formation occur during anaphylaxis in human. C5a caused rapid release of histamine and tryptase from HHMCs. These cells are activated in vitro by therapeutic (general anaesthetics, protamine, etc.) and diagnostic agents (radio contrast media, etc.) that may cause non-IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions.

One economic analysis published thus far reported lower costs than in-person care. We hypothesized that telegenetics can also be beneficial from the professional's view in relatively small geographical areas. We performed a pilot study in the Northern Netherlands of 51 home-based online counseling sessions for cardiogenetic and oncogenetic cascade screening, and urgent prenatal counseling. Previously, we showed patient satisfaction, anxiety, and perceived control of online counseling to be comparable to in-person counseling. This study focuses on expectations, satisfaction, and practical evaluations of the involved counselors, and the impact in terms of time and costs. Most counselors expected disadvantages of online counseling for themselves and their patients, mainly concerning insufficient non-verbal communication; few expected advantages for themselves. Afterwards, counselors additionally raised the disadvantage of insufficient verbal communication, and reported frequent technical problems. Their overall mean telemedicine satisfaction itemscore was 3.38 before, and 2.95 afterwards, being afterwards slightly below the minimum level we set for a satisfactory result. We estimated reduced time and costs by online counseling with about 8% and 10-12%, respectively. We showed online genetic counseling to be effective, feasible and cost-efficient, but technical improvements are needed to increase counselors' satisfaction.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"We estimated reduced time and costs by online counseling with about 8% and 10-12%, respectively. \"]}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

Memory deficits in aging affect millions of people and are often disturbing to those concerned. Dissection of the molecular control of learning and memory is paramount to understand and possibly enhance cognitive functions. Old-age memory loss also has been recently linked to altered Ca(2+) homeostasis. We have previously identified DREAM (downstream regulatory element antagonistic modulator), a member of the neuronal Ca(2+) sensor superfamily of EF-hand proteins, with specific roles in different cell compartments. In the nucleus, DREAM is a Ca(2+)-dependent transcriptional repressor, binding to specific DNA signatures, or interacting with nucleoproteins regulating their transcriptional properties. Also, we and others have shown that dream mutant (dream(-/-)) mice exhibit marked analgesia. Here we report that dream(-/-) mice exhibit markedly enhanced learning and synaptic plasticity related to improved cognition. Mechanistically, DREAM functions as a negative regulator of the key memory factor CREB in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, and loss of DREAM facilitates CREB-dependent transcription during learning. Intriguingly, 18-month-old dream(-/-) mice display learning and memory capacities similar to young mice. Moreover, loss of DREAM protects from brain degeneration in aging. These data identify the Ca(2+)-regulated \"pain gene\" DREAM as a novel key regulator of memory and brain aging.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Risk prediction models for postoperative mortality after intra-abdominal surgery have typically been developed using preoperative variables. It is unclear if intraoperative data add significant value to these risk prediction models. With IRB approval, an institutional retrospective cohort of intra-abdominal surgery patients in the 2005 to 2015 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was identified. Intraoperative data were obtained from the electronic health record. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. We evaluated the performance of machine learning algorithms to predict 30-day mortality using: 1) baseline variables and 2) baseline + intraoperative variables. Algorithms evaluated were: 1) logistic regression with elastic net selection, 2) random forest (RF), 3) gradient boosting machine (GBM), 4) support vector machine (SVM), and 5) convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). The sample was randomly divided into a training/testing split with 80%/20% probabilities. Repeated 10-fold cross-validation identified the optimal model hyperparameters in the training dataset for each model, which were then applied to the entire training dataset to train the model. Trained models were applied to the test cohort to evaluate model performance. Statistical significance was evaluated using P < .05. The training and testing cohorts contained 4322 and 1079 patients, respectively, with 62 (1.4%) and 15 (1.4%) experiencing 30-day mortality, respectively. When using only baseline variables to predict mortality, all algorithms except SVM (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.83 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.69-0.97]) had AUROC >0.9: GBM (AUROC, 0.96 [0.94-1.0]), RF (AUROC, 0.96 [0.92-1.0]), CNN (AUROC, 0.96 [0.92-0.99]), and logistic regression (AUROC, 0.95 [0.91-0.99]). AUROC significantly increased with intraoperative variables with CNN (AUROC, 0.97 [0.96-0.99]; P = .047 versus baseline), but there was no improvement with GBM (AUROC, 0.97 [0.95-0.99]; P = .3 versus baseline), RF (AUROC, 0.96 [0.93-1.0]; P = .5 versus baseline), and logistic regression (AUROC, 0.94 [0.90-0.99]; P = .6 versus baseline).

Anaphylaxis is a rapidly evolving, acute, life-threatening reaction that occurs rapidly on contact with a trigger.

However, it is clear that non-IgE-mediated pathways can induce symptoms indistinguishable from those of classic anaphylaxis, and their activation could explain the severity of IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. Indeed, mast cells and basophils can be activated by antibodies against IgE or their receptors, by molecules such as anaphylatoxins, or through G-coupled receptors. Some other allergens can induce antibodies of class IgG that can activate neutrophils to produce a molecule similar to histamine to induce anaphylaxis. Finally, some inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin or prostaglandin can also modulate mast cell and basophil activation as well as directly cause vasodilation and bronchoconstriction, resulting in anaphylaxis-like reactions.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Anaphylaxis is a rapidly evolving, acute, life-threatening reaction that occurs rapidly on contact with a trigger.

Cholestasis, roughly divided into intrahepatic and extrahepatic forms, is a clinical challenge. Extrahepatic cholestasis, characterized by dilated bile ducts, is caused by either a bile duct stone or stricture, with stricture most often related to a malignancy. The aim of the present study was to analyze the value of common liver function tests in separating patients with malignant bile duct strictures from those with stones. All consecutive patients admitted for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were included in the study population if a bile duct stricture related to a malignancy was found by ERCP (n=103) or if a bile duct stone was successfully extracted during ERCP, thus confirming the diagnosis of a stone (n=109). Plasma alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin values were determined in the morning before ERCP. Plasma bilirubin (p<0.001), alkaline phosphatase (p<0.001) and alanine aminotransferase (p=0.040) levels were significantly higher in patients with malignant bile duct strictures than in those with bile duct stones. In addition, gamma-glutamyltransferase levels seemed to be higher in patients with malignant strictures than in those with stones, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.053). In receiver operating characteristic analyses, bilirubin proved to be the best laboratory test in differentiating patients (p=0.001 vs. alkaline phosphatase, p<0.001 vs. alanine aminotransferase and p<0.001 vs. gamma-glutamyltransferase).

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common manifestation of chronic kidney disease (CKD), affecting most patients on hemodialysis and imposing a substantial clinical burden. Treatment with iron supplementation increases hemoglobin levels and can reduce the severity of anemia in patients with CKD. While correcting anemia in these patients is an important therapeutic goal, there is a lack of long-term trials directly comparing intravenous iron therapies in patients with CKD receiving hemodialysis. The Ferumoxytol for Anemia of CKD Trial (FACT) is a 13-month, open-label, randomized, multicenter, international, prospective study with 2 substudies. Entry criteria for the main study include adults with IDA (defined as hemoglobin <11.5\u00a0g/dL [<115.0\u00a0g/L] and a transferrin saturation <30%), serum ferritin <800\u00a0ng/mL (<1798 pmol/L), and receiving hemodialysis for \u22653\u00a0months. Patients are randomized to receive ferumoxytol (1.02\u00a0g over 2 doses) or iron sucrose (1.0\u00a0g over 10 doses) during the initial 5-week treatment period. Those with persistent/recurrent IDA over the 11-month observation period will receive additional 5-week treatment periods, as appropriate. The primary efficacy endpoint of the main study is the mean change in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5 for each treatment period. The secondary efficacy endpoints include the mean change in transferrin saturation from Baseline to Week 5 and the proportion of patients with a hemoglobin increase of \u22651.0\u00a0g/dL at any time from Baseline to Week 5. Safety will be assessed through an examination of the adverse event profile over the course of the study. An \"oxidative stress\" substudy in approximately 100 patients will assess the effects of treatment on biomarkers of oxidative stress/inflammation during the initial 5-week treatment period, and a magnetic resonance imaging substudy in approximately 70 patients will assess the potential for iron deposition in target tissues over 24\u00a0months. FACT fulfills the need for a long-term comparative trial in patients with IDA and CKD receiving hemodialysis.

Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a recently identified coinhibitory molecule that belongs to the CD28 superfamily. PD-1 has two ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. There is some evidence that PD-L1 and PD-L2 serve distinct functions, but their exact function in alloimmunity remains unclear. In the present study, we used a GVHD-like model that allows detailed analyses of T-cell activation at a single cell level in vivo to examine the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and PD-1/PD-L2 interactions in regulating proliferation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in response to alloantigen stimulation. We found that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells proliferated vigorously in vivo and that PD-L1 and PD-L2 exhibit strikingly different effect on T-cell proliferation. While blocking PD-L1 did not affect the in vivo proliferation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells regardless of CD28 costimulation, blocking PD-L2 resulted in a marked increase in the responder frequency of CD8(+) T-cells in vivo. The effect of PD-L2 on the CD8(+) T-cell proliferation is regulated by CD28 costimulation and by the CD4(+) T cells. We conclude that PD-L1 and PD-L2 function differently in regulating alloreactive T-cell activation in vivo, and PD-L2 is predominant in this model in limiting alloreactive CD8(+) T-cell proliferation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"PD-1 has two ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2.\"]}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Neuropathic pain (NP) is a main feature of Fabry disease (FD) as consequence of small fiber neuropathy. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) in FD was not described, but it is an important feature in other small fiber neuropathies, i.e., diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of RLS in patients with FD, and its association with neuropathy. We investigated the occurrence of RLS in four families of classical FD, diagnosed in accordance with the criteria of the International RLS Study Group. Eleven patients, 6 hemicigote and 5 heterocigote, ages among 19 to 32 years old for males and 45 to 56 years old for females, were studied. The 6 hemizigote and 2 heterozigote patients were on enzyme therapy with agalsidase beta. One heterocigote patient had not clinical NP and the other 10 patients had small fiber sensory neuropathy with symptoms: burning and painful feet. RLS was present in 3/6 hemicigote and 1/5 heterocigote patients (36%). In these four patients, RLS was associated with dysesthesias or pain crisis and it was characterized to be a desire to move the low extremities as crisis of motor restlessness. RLS was characterized for worsening of symptoms with rest without diurnal changes. Patients have to uncover the feet for improving burning or sometimes they have to get out of bed in the night looking for relief. Both NP and RLS improved after 3 years of enzyme replacement therapy. Our data shows that RLS is associated to NP as a treatable manifestation of small fiber involvement in the course of FD.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Neuropathic pain (NP) is a main feature of Fabry disease (FD) as consequence of small fiber neuropathy.

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds.

Necroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death mediated by the pseudokinase mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). Upon phosphorylation by receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3), MLKL oligomerizes, and translocates to and disrupts the plasma membrane, thereby causing necroptotic cell lysis. Herein, we show that activation of necroptosis in mouse dermal fibroblasts (MDFs) and HT-29 human colorectal cancer cells results in accumulation of the autophagic marker, lipidated LC3B (also known as MAP1LC3B), in an MLKL-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, the necroptosis-induced increase in lipidated LC3B was due to inhibition of autophagic flux, not the activation of autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy by MLKL correlated with a decrease in autophagosome and/or autolysosome function, and required the association of activated MLKL with intracellular membranes. Collectively, our findings uncover an additional role for the MLKL pseudokinase, namely to inhibit autophagy during necroptosis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"anslocates to and disrupts the plasma membrane, thereby causing necroptotic cell lysis.

Sixty-two publications met inclusion criteria developing 152 models across all publications. Forty-two models were regression-based, 71 were non-regression-based and 39 were ensemble models. A median of 647 individuals (IQR: 203 to 4059) and 195 events (IQR: 38 to 1269) were used for model development, and 553 individuals (IQR: 69 to 3069) and 50 events (IQR: 17.5 to 326.5) for model validation. A higher number of events per predictor was used for developing regression-based models (median: 8, IQR: 7.1 to 23.5), compared to alternative machine learning (median: 3.4, IQR: 1.1 to 19.1) and ensemble models (median: 1.7, IQR: 1.1 to 6).

Ten out of 24 models for time-to-event outcomes accounted for censoring (42%). A split sample approach was the most popular method for internal validation (n\u2009=\u200925/62, 40%).

Telegenetics involves the use of technology (generally video conferencing) to remotely provide genetic services. A telegenetics platform is critical for those with limitations or vulnerabilities compromising their ability to attend clinic in-person, including individuals in rural areas. As the demand for remote genetics services increases, and amidst the COVID-19 pandemic with social distancing practices in place, we conducted a literature review to examine the benefits and limitations of telegenetics and explore the views of patients and health professionals utilizing telegenetics. Searches of the PubMed database identified 21 relevant primary studies for inclusion. The majority of studies found acceptability of telegenetics to be high among patients and health professionals and that telegenetics provided access to genetics services for underserved communities. The main benefits cited include cost-effectiveness and reduction in travel time for genetics services providing outreach clinics and patients who would otherwise travel long distances to access genetics. Patients appreciated the convenience of telegenetics including the reduced wait times, although a minority of patients reported their psychosocial needs were not adequately met. Eight studies compared outcomes between telegenetics and in-person services; findings suggested when comparing telegenetics patients to their in-person counterparts, telegenetics patients had a similar level of knowledge and understanding of genetics and similar psychological outcomes. Some studies reported challenges related to establishing rapport and reading and responding to verbal cues via telegenetics, while technical issues were not generally found to be a major limitation. Some service adaptations, for example, counseling strategies, may be required to successfully deliver telegenetics. Further research may be necessary to gather and examine data on how telegenetics outcomes compare to that of in-person genetic counseling and adapt services accordingly.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Telegenetics involves the use of technology (generally video conferencing) to remotely provide genetic services.

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

In little more than a decade, induced exon skipping as a therapy to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has progressed from a concept tested in vitro, to pre-clinical evaluation in mouse and dog models, and recent completion of Phase I clinical trials in man. There is no longer any doubt that antisense oligomers can redirect dystrophin gene processing and by-pass protein truncating mutations after direct injection into muscle. Proof-of-concept has been demonstrated in human dystrophic muscle, with trials in Leiden and London showing that two different oligomer chemistries can restore the reading-frame in selected DMD patients by excising dystrophin exon 51. Systemic delivery of both oligomer types into DMD patients has commenced with promising results but it remains to be established if this therapy will have measurable clinical benefits. Targeted removal of exon 51 will only be directly applicable to about one in ten DMD individuals, and the immediate challenges include development of appropriate and effective delivery regimens, and extending splice-switching therapies to other dystrophin gene lesions. The success of induced exon skipping has spawned a number of \"fusion therapies\", including vector-mediated dystrophin exon skipping and ex vivo viral delivery of splice-switching antisense molecules into myogenic stem cells, followed by implantation, which may address long term oligomer delivery issues. This review summarizes the pivotal events leading to the completion of the first proof-of-concept trials and speculates on some of the scientific, ethical, regulatory and commercial challenges facing targeted exon skipping for the treatment of DMD.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The success of induced exon skipping has spawned a number of \\\"fusion therapies\\\", including vector-mediated dystrophin exon skipping and ex vivo viral delivery of splice-switching antisense molecules into myogenic stem cells, followed by implantation, which may address long term oligomer delivery issues.\"]}"}]}

Individual patient data (N=2282) from 11 clinical trials and observational studies using chemotherapy regimens with > or =15% FN risk and PPP (6 mg, all cycles) or CP (no G-CSF or any cycle G-CSF/pegfilgrastim) were included in an integrated analysis. Most patients received docetaxel-containing regimens. A generalised linear mixed model was fitted (N=2210). Neutropaenia prophylaxis (PPP versus CP), age and disease stage influenced the incidence of FN. Overall, FN was less frequent with PPP than with CP (odds ratio [OR]: 0.124; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08, 0.194; P<0.0001). Odds for cycle 1 FN, dose reductions > or =15% and FN-related hospitalisation were also significantly lower with PPP.

Cyclin Dependent Kinase 9 (CDK9) is one of the most important transcription regulatory members of the CDK family. In conjunction with its main cyclin partner-Cyclin T1, it forms the Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) whose primary function in eukaryotic cells is to mediate the positive transcription elongation of nascent mRNA strands, by phosphorylating the S2 residues of the YSPTSPS tandem repeats at the C-terminus domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II). To aid in this process, P-TEFb also simultaneously phosphorylates and inactivates a number of negative transcription regulators like 5,6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) Sensitivity-Inducing Factor (DSIF) and Negative Elongation Factor (NELF). Significantly enhanced activity of CDK9 is observed in multiple cancer types, which is universally associated with significantly shortened Overall Survival (OS) of the patients. In these cancer types, CDK9 regulates a plethora of cellular functions including proliferation, survival, cell cycle regulation, DNA damage repair and metastasis. Due to the extremely critical role of CDK9 in cancer cells, inhibiting its functions has been the subject of intense research, resulting the development of multiple, increasingly specific small-molecule inhibitors, some of which are presently in clinical trials. The search for newer generation CDK9 inhibitors with higher specificity and lower potential toxicities and suitable combination therapies continues. In fact, the Phase I clinical trials of the latest, highly specific CDK9 inhibitor BAY1251152, against different solid tumors have shown good anti-tumor and on-target activities and pharmacokinetics, combined with manageable safety profile while the phase I and II clinical trials of another inhibitor AT-7519 have been undertaken or are undergoing. To enhance the effectiveness and target diversity and reduce potential drug-resistance, the future of CDK9 inhibition would likely involve combining CDK9 inhibitors with inhibitors like those against BRD4, SEC, MYC, MCL-1 and HSP90.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Cyclin Dependent Kinase 9 (CDK9) is one of the most important transcription regulatory members of the CDK family.

Besides its antiarrhythmic action, carvedilol has an activity to suppress cardiac tissue damage. However, it is unknown whether it has any effect on cellular apoptosis and ion channel remodelling. To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Carvedilol suppressed apoptosis of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC through modification of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, whose was associated with an increase of Cav 1.2 protein expression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

This study was to explore the clinical efficacy and safety of darbepoetin alfa injection replacing epoetin alfa injection (recombinant human erythropoietin injection, rHuEPO) for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney failure in Chinese patients undergoing hemodialysis. This study was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, intergroup parallel control phase III noninferiority trial from April 19, 2013 to September 9, 2014 at 25 sites. In this study, the members of the darbepoetin alfa group underwent intravenous administration once per week or once every two weeks. The members of the control drug epoetin alfa group underwent intravenous administration two or three times per week. All subjects underwent epoetin alfa administration during the 8-week baseline period. After that, subjects were randomly assigned to the darbepoetin alfa group or epoetin alfa group. The noninferiority in the changes of the average Hb concentrations from the baseline to the end of the evaluation period (noninferiority threshold: -1.0\u2009g/dl) was tested between the two treatments. The time-dependent hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and the maintenance rate of the target Hb concentration (the proportion of subjects with Hb concentrations between 10.0 and 12.0\u2009g/dl) were also evaluated. Iron metabolism, including changes in the serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and comparisons of the dose adjustments between the two groups during the treatment period were analyzed further. Adverse events (AEs) were also observed and compared, and the safety was analyzed between the two treatment groups. The conversion rate switching from epoetin alfa to darbepoetin alfa was also discussed. SAS\u00ae software version 9.2 was used to perform all statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics were used for all efficacy, safety, and demographic variable analyses, including for the primary efficacy indicators. Four hundred and sixty-six patients were enrolled in this study, and ultimately 384 cases were analyzed for safety, including 267 cases in the darbepoetin alfa group and 117 cases in the epoetin alfa group. There were 211 cases in the per-protocol set, including 152 cases in the darbepoetin alfa group and 59 cases in the epoetin alfa group. The changes in the average Hb concentrations from the baseline to the end of the evaluation period were -0.07 and -0.15\u2009g/dl in the darbepoetin alfa group and epoetin alfa group respectively. The difference between the two groups was 0.08\u2009g/dl (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.22 to 0.39), and the lower limit of the 95% CI was -0.22\u2009>\u2009-1.0\u2009g/dl. The average Hb concentrations of the two groups were 10.88-11.43\u2009g/dl (darbepoetin alfa) and 10.91-11.38\u2009g/dl (epoetin alfa) during the study period of Weeks 0-28, with the maintenance rates of the target Hb concentration ranging within 71%-87% and 78%-95% in the darbepoetin alfa group and epoetin alfa group respectively. During the period of comparison between the two groups, the incidence of AEs in the darbepoetin alfa group was 61.42%, while in the epoetin alfa group it was 56.41%. All of the adverse events and reactions in the study were those commonly associated with hemodialysis. The overall efficacy and safety of darbepoetin alfa for the treatment of Chinese renal anemia patients undergoing hemodialysis are consistent with those of epoetin alfa.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"This study was to explore the clinical efficacy and safety of darbepoetin alfa injection replacing epoetin alfa injection (recombinant human erythropoietin injection, rHuEPO) for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney failure\"]}"}]}

This review summarizes recent advances in the molecular classification of adult gliomas. According to the 2016 WHO classification, five main molecular subgroups of adult diffuse gliomas can be distinguished based on the 1p/19q codeletion, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and histone H3.3 mutation status. In the future, this classification may be further refined based on the integration of additional biomarkers, in particular CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion in IDH-mutant astrocytomas, TERT promoter mutations, EGFR amplification, chromosome 7 gain and chromosome 10 loss in IDH-wildtype astrocytomas, and FGFR1 mutations in midline gliomas. Histone H3.3 G34R/V defines a distinct subgroup of hemispheric IDH-wildtype high-grade gliomas occurring in young patients and FGFR gene fusions characterize a subgroup of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas that could benefit from specific treatment approaches. RNA sequencing may identify targetable gene fusions in circumscribed gliomas lacking classical BRAF alterations. In chordoid gliomas, recurrent PRKCA mutations could serve as a new diagnostic marker. Among comprehensive molecular analysis methods, DNA methylation profiling appears as a particularly powerful approach to identify new molecular subgroups of gliomas and to classify difficult cases. The classification of adult gliomas may be improved by the integration of additional biomarkers and/or by comprehensive molecular analysis, in particular DNA methylation profiling. The most relevant approach, however, remains to be established.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"O classification, five main molecular subgroups of adult diffuse gliomas can be distinguished based on the 1p/19q codeletion, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and histone H3.3 mutation status.

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Boys aged 4-7 years were recruited in the FOR-DMD study, a comparative effectiveness study of different steroid regimens in DMD. Eligible boys had to be able to rise from the floor independently and to perform pulmonary function testing consistently. The boys were evaluated with standardized assessments at the screening and baseline visits at 32 sites in 5 countries (US, UK, Canada, Italy, Germany). Assessments included timed rise from floor, timed 10\u202fm walk/run, six-minute walk distance, North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Mean age at baseline was 5.9 years (range 4.1-8.1 years). Test-retest reliability was high for functional assessments, regardless of time lag between assessments (up to 90 days) and for the majority of age groups.

Abnormal dystrophin production due to mutations in the dystrophin gene causes Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Cases demonstrate considerable genetic and disease progression variability. It is unclear if specific gene mutations are prognostic of outcomes in this population. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of DMD patients followed at 17 centers across the USA and Canada from 2005 to 2015 with goal of understanding the genetic variability of DMD and its impact on clinical outcomes. Cumulative incidence of clinically relevant outcomes was stratified by genetic mutation type, exon mutation location, and extent of exon deletion. Of 436 males with DMD, 324 (74.3%) underwent genetic testing. Deletions were the most common mutation type (256, 79%), followed by point mutations (45, 13.9%) and duplications (23, 7.1%). There were 131 combinations of mutations with most mutations located along exons 45 to 52. The number of exons deleted varied between 1 and 52 with a median of 3 exons deleted (IQR 1-6). Subjects with mutations starting at exon positions 40-54 had a later onset of arrhythmias occurring at median age 25\u00a0years (95% CI 18-\u221e), p\u2009=\u20090.01.

PD-L1 and PD-L2 are ligands for PD-1, a costimulatory molecule that plays an inhibitory role in regulating T cell activation in the periphery. We find that PD-L1 is highly expressed on inflammatory macrophages as compared with resident peritoneal macrophages but can be induced on resident macrophages by classical activation stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide, IFN-gamma, and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. Further up-regulation of PD-L1 on inflammatory macrophages can also be induced by subsequent exposure to lipopolysaccharide and IFN-gamma. In contrast, PD-L2 is not expressed on inflammatory macrophages but can be induced by alternative activation via IL-4. Although PD-L1 is highly inducible on a variety of antigen-presenting cell lines as well as resident macrophages, PD-L2 is most significantly inducible only on inflammatory macrophages. PD-L1 up-regulation depends on TLR4 and STAT1, whereas PD-L2 expression depends on IL-4R alpha and STAT6. Consistent with these results, T helper 1T helper 2 (Th1/Th2) cells also differentially up-regulate PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression on inflammatory macrophages. Hence, Th1 cells as well as microbial products can enhance PD-L1 expression on many different macrophage populations, whereas Th2 cells instruct only inflammatory macrophages to up-regulate PD-L2. These results suggest that PD-L1 and PD-L2 might have different functions in regulating type 1 and type 2 responses.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"PD-L1 and PD-L2 are ligands for PD-1, a costimulatory molecule that plays an inhibitory role in regulating T cell activation in the periphery.\"]}"}]}

Recent advances in molecular therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) require precise genetic diagnosis because most therapeutic strategies are mutation-specific. To understand more about the genotype-phenotype correlations of the DMD gene we performed a comprehensive analysis of the DMD mutational spectrum in a large series of families. Here we provide the clinical, pathological and genetic features of 576 dystrophinopathy patients. DMD gene analysis was performed using the MLPA technique and whole gene sequencing in blood DNA and muscle cDNA. The impact of the DNA variants on mRNA splicing and protein functionality was evaluated by in silico analysis using computational algorithms. DMD mutations were detected in 576 unrelated dystrophinopathy families by combining the analysis of exonic copies and the analysis of small mutations. We found that 471 of these mutations were large intragenic rearrangements. Of these, 406 (70.5%) were exonic deletions, 64 (11.1%) were exonic duplications, and one was a deletion/duplication complex rearrangement (0.2%). Small mutations were identified in 105 cases (18.2%), most being nonsense/frameshift types (75.2%). Mutations in splice sites, however, were relatively frequent (20%). In total, 276 mutations were identified, 85 of which have not been previously described. The diagnostic algorithm used proved to be accurate for the molecular diagnosis of dystrophinopathies. The reading frame rule was fulfilled in 90.4% of DMD patients and in 82.4% of Becker muscular dystrophy patients (BMD), with significant differences between the mutation types. We found that 58% of DMD patients would be included in single exon-exon skipping trials, 63% from strategies directed against multiexon-skipping exons 45 to 55, and 14% from PTC therapy. A detailed analysis of missense mutations provided valuable information about their impact on the protein structure. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Of these, 406 (70.5%) were exonic deletions, 64 (11.1%) were exonic duplications, and one was a deletion/duplication complex rearrangement (0.2%).

Proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) has been developed to be a useful technology for targeted protein degradation. A bifunctional PROTAC molecule consists of a ligand (mostly small-molecule inhibitor) of the protein of interest (POI) and a covalently linked ligand of an E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3). Upon binding to the POI, the PROTAC can recruit E3 for POI ubiquitination, which is subjected to proteasome-mediated degradation. PROTAC complements nucleic acid-based gene knockdown/out technologies for targeted protein reduction and could mimic pharmacological protein inhibition. To date, PROTACs targeting ~ 50 proteins, many of which are clinically validated drug targets, have been successfully developed with several in clinical trials for cancer therapy.

A systematic review. Aim This systematic review sought to assess and scrutinise the validity and practicality of published and preprint reports of prediction models for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with COVID-19, and for identifying individuals in the general population at increased risk of infection with COVID-19 or being hospitalised with the illness.Data sources A systematic, online search was conducted in PubMed and Embase. In order to do so, the authors used Ovid as the host platform for these two databases and also investigated bioRxiv, medRxiv and arXiv as repositories for the preprints of studies. A public living systematic review list of COVID-19-related studies was used as the baseline searching platform (Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine's repository for living evidence on COVID-19).Study selection Studies which developed or validated a multivariable prediction model related to COVID-19 patients' data (individual level data) were included. The authors did not put any restrictions on the models included in their study regarding the model setting, prediction horizon or outcomes.Data extraction and synthesis Checklists of critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies (CHARMS) and prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST) were used to guide developing of a standardised data extraction form. Each model's predictive performance was extracted by using any summaries of discrimination and calibration. All these steps were done according to the aspects of the transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) and preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA).Results One hundred and forty-five prediction models (107 studies) were selected for data extraction and critical appraisal. The most common predictors of diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 were age, body temperature, lymphocyte count and lung imaging characteristics. Influenza-like symptoms and neutrophil count were regularly predictive in diagnostic models, while comorbidities, sex, C-reactive protein and creatinine were common prognostic items. C-indices (a measure of discrimination for models) ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population, from 0.65 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models, and from 0.68 to 0.99 in the prognostic models. All the included studies were reported to have high risks of bias.Conclusions Overall, this study did not recommend applying any of the predictive models in clinical practice yet. High risk of bias, reporting problems and (probably) optimistic reported performances are all among the reasons for the previous conclusion. Prompt actions regarding accurate data sharing and international collaborations are required to achieve more rigorous prediction models for COVID-19.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The authors did not put any restrictions on the models included in their study regarding the model setting, prediction horizon or outcomes.Data extraction and synthesis Checklists of critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies (CHARMS) and prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST) were used to guide developing of a standardised data extraction form.\"]}"}]}

Because of the lack of global accessibility, delay, and cost-effectiveness of genetic testing, there is a clinical need for an imaging-based stratification of gliomas that can prognosticate survival and correlate with the 2021-WHO classification. In this retrospective study, adult primary glioma patients with pre-surgery/pre-treatment MRI brain images having T2, FLAIR, T1, T1 post-contrast, DWI sequences, and survival information were included in TCIA training-dataset (n\u2009=\u2009275) and independent validation-dataset (n\u2009=\u2009200). A flowchart for imaging-based stratification of adult gliomas(IBGS) was created in consensus by three authors to encompass all adult glioma types. Diagnostic features used were T2-FLAIR mismatch sign, central necrosis with peripheral enhancement, diffusion restriction, and continuous cortex sign. Roman numerals (I, II, and III) denote IBGS types. Two independent teams of three and two radiologists, blinded to genetic, histology, and survival information, manually read MRI into three types based on the flowchart. Overall survival-analysis was done using age-adjusted Cox-regression analysis, which provided both hazard-ratio (HR) and area-under-curve (AUC) for each stratification system(IBGS and 2021-WHO). The sensitivity and specificity of each IBSG type were analyzed with cross-table to identify the corresponding 2021-WHO genotype. Imaging-based stratification was statistically significant in predicting survival in both datasets with good inter-observer agreement (age-adjusted Cox-regression, AUC\u2009>\u20090.5, k\u2009>\u20090.6, p\u2009<\u20090.001). IBGS type-I, type-II, and type-III gliomas had good specificity in identifying IDHmut 1p19q-codel oligodendroglioma (training - 97%, validation - 85%); IDHmut 1p19q non-codel astrocytoma (training - 80%, validation - 85.9%); and IDHwt glioblastoma (training - 76.5%, validation- 87.3%) respectively (p-value\u2009<\u20090.01).

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

A prognostic prediction model for metabolic syndrome can calculate the probability of risk of experiencing metabolic syndrome within a specific period for individualized treatment decisions. We aimed to provide a systematic review and critical appraisal on prognostic models for metabolic syndrome. Studies were identified through searching in English databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science) and Chinese databases (Sinomed, WANFANG, CNKI, and CQVIP). A checklist for critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modeling studies (CHARMS) and the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST) were used for the data extraction process and critical appraisal. From the 29,668 retrieved articles, eleven studies meeting the selection criteria were included in this review. Forty-eight predictors were identified from prognostic prediction models. The c-statistic ranged from 0.67 to 0.95. Critical appraisal has shown that all modeling studies were subject to a high risk of bias in methodological quality mainly driven by outcome and statistical analysis, and six modeling studies were subject to a high risk of bias in applicability. Future model development and validation studies should adhere to the transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement to improve methodological quality and applicability, thus increasing the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study. It is not appropriate to adopt any of the identified models in this study for clinical practice since all models are prone to optimism and overfitting.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"ical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modeling studies (CHARMS) and the prediction model risk of bias assessment too\", \"ical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modeling studies (CHARMS) and the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST) were used for the data extraction process and critical appraisal.RESULTS: From the 29\"]}"}]}

The apparent selectivity of agnosia for faces is termed prosopagnosia or face blindness. This cognitive dysfunction can be seen after traumatic events--involving at least the right occipital temporal region--or very frequently congenital in the absence of any detectable lesions. The familiarity of congenital prosopagnosia was studied in two independently ascertained collections of subjects with prosopagnosia. One was an unselected group of pupils and students who underwent a questionnaire based screening. The others were self reported subjects after having heard for the first time about the phenomenon of prosopagnosia from mass media citing our studies and/or from our homepage (www.prosopagnosia.de). Those who agreed with consecutive studies of their family members had mostly one or more prosopagnosic first degree relatives. The segregation patterns derived from 39 families are compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance. Hence, mutation(s) in one gene are sufficient for manifestation of the phenotype. Still fitting the concept of autosomal dominant inheritance, we have evidence for a slightly reduced penetrance (4 normal transmitters from distinct families) and one or two de novo mutations.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The apparent selectivity of agnosia for faces is termed prosopagnosia or face blindness.\"]}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type I (PFIC1) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic mutations of ATP8B1 gene, with progressive cholestasis as the main clinical manifestation. This paper reports the clinical and genetic features of a PFIC1 patient definitely diagnosed by ATP8B1 genetic analysis. The patient, a boy aged 14 months, was referred to the hospital with the complaint of jaundiced skin and sclera over 10 months. The patient had been managed in different hospitals, but the therapeutic effects were unsatisfactory due to undetermined etiology. On physical examination, hepatosplenomegaly was discovered in addition to jaundice of the skin and sclera. The liver was palpable 4 cm below the right subcostal margin and 2 cm below the xiphoid while the spleen 2\u2005cm below the left subcostal margin. The liver function test revealed elevated levels of serum total bile acids, bilirubin, and transaminases; however, the \u03b3-glutamyl transferase level was normal. The diagnosis was genetic cholestasis of undetermined origin. At the age of 1 year and 8 months, a Roux-en-Y cholecystocolonic bypass operation was performed, and thereafter the jaundice disappeared. At 5 years and 1 month, via whole genome sequencing analysis and Sanger sequencing confirmation, the boy was found to be a homozygote of mutation c.2081T>A(p.I694N) of ATP8B1 gene, and thus PFIC1 was definitely diagnosed. The boy was followed up until he was 6 years, and jaundice did not recur, but the long-term outcome remains to be observed. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" The liver function test revealed elevated levels of serum total bile acids, bilirubin, and transaminases; however, the \\u00ce\\u00b3-glutamyl transferase level was norma\"]}"}]}

Prosopagnosia (PA) or face blindness is characterized by a deficiency in identifying familiar faces. Almost all reports are single cases or collections of unrelated patients who acquired prosopagnosia after brain injuries, strokes or atrophy of at least the right occipito-temporal cortex. Until 2001, the inborn form - in the absence of any brain lesions - was described in fewer than 20 probands exclusively of Caucasian origin. We recently found that in the German Caucasian population, congenital prosopagnosia has a very high prevalence of at least 2.5% and that it is genetically determined. It is best described by autosomal-dominant inheritance in the more than 50 families investigated. We therefore introduced the term non-syndromic hereditary PA for the congenital form of a monosymptomatic or isolated PA. This surprisingly high frequency in the Caucasian population prompted us to extend our search to other ethnic groups. We performed a questionnaire-based screening among 198 native Indian students at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi. In a then selected subset, we found after further detailed diagnostic interviews one Bengali female student with visual agnosia for face recognition only. Several other members of her large family reported the same impairment of face recognition. The segregation pattern of PA in this family is also compatible with autosomal-dominant inheritance.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Prosopagnosia (PA) or face blindness is characterized by a deficiency in identifying familiar faces.\"]}"}]}

To provide an overview and critical appraisal of prediction models for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify relevant studies (up to November 2021). We included studies that reported prediction model development and/or validation of BPD in preterm infants born at \u226432 weeks and/or \u22641,500 g birth weight. We extracted the data independently based on the CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS). We assessed risk of bias and applicability independently using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). Twenty-one prediction models from 13 studies reporting on model development and 21 models from 10 studies reporting on external validation were included. Oxygen dependency at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age was the most frequently reported outcome in both development studies (71%) and validation studies (81%). The most frequently used predictors in the models were birth weight (67%), gestational age (62%), and sex (52%). Nearly all included studies had high risk of bias, most often due to inadequate analysis. Small sample sizes and insufficient event patients were common in both study types. Missing data were often not reported or were discarded. Most studies reported on the models' discrimination, while calibration was seldom assessed (development, 19%; validation, 10%). Internal validation was lacking in 69% of development studies. The included studies had many methodological shortcomings. Future work should focus on following the recommended approaches for developing and validating BPD prediction models.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS).\"]}"}]}

Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The splicing of microexons (very small exons) is frequently dysregulated in the brain of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. However, little is known of the patterns, regulatory mechanisms and roles of microexon splicing in cancer. We here examined the transcriptome-wide profile of microexon splicing in matched colorectal cancer (CRC) and normal tissue specimens. Out of 1492 microexons comprising 3 to 15 nucleotides, 21 (1%) manifested differential splicing between CRC and normal tissue. The 21 genes harboring the differentially spliced microexons were enriched in gene ontology terms related to cell adhesion and migration. RNA interference-mediated knockdown experiments identified two splicing factors, RBFOX2 and PTBP1, as regulators of microexon splicing in CRC cells. RBFOX2 and PTBP1 were found to directly bind to microexon-containing pre-mRNAs and to control their splicing in such cells. Differential microexon splicing was shown to be due, at least in part, to altered expression of RBFOX2 and PTBP1 in CRC tissue compared to matched normal tissue. Finally, we found that changes in the pattern of microexon splicing were associated with CRC metastasis. Our data thus suggest that altered expression of RBFOX2 and PTBP1 might influence CRC metastasis through the regulation of microexon splicing.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Alternative microexon splicing by RBFOX2 and PTBP1 is associated with metastasis in colorectal cancer.\", \"RNA interference-mediated knockdown experiments identified two splicing factors, RBFOX2 and PTBP1, as regulators of microexon splicing in CRC cells.

The receptor tyrosine kinase FLT-3 is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia; however, current small molecule inhibitors suffer from limited efficacy in the clinic. Conversion of a FLT-3 inhibitor (quizartinib) into a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) results in a compound that induces degradation of FLT-3 ITD mutant at low nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, the PROTAC is capable of inhibiting cell growth more potently than the warhead alone while inhibiting fewer off-target kinases. This enhanced antiproliferative activity occurs, despite a slight reduction in the PROTAC's kinase inhibitory activity, via an increased level of apoptosis induction suggesting nonkinase roles for the FLT-3 ITD protein. Additionally, the PROTAC is capable of inducing FLT-3 ITD degradation in vivo.

Mantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive, non-curable B-cell lymphoma, characterized by the translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) involving CCND1 and a high number of additional genetic alterations. Chromosomal gains of 7p are frequent in mantle cell lymphoma, with insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3 aka IMP3) being the most upregulated gene in this region. IGF2BP3 is a member of the IGF II mRNA-BP family, and increased IGF2BP3 expression is associated with an aggressive behavior in many malignant tumors. We here analyze selected genes related to IGF signaling in gene expression and genomic array data of 8 mantle cell lymphoma cell lines and 12 primary mantle cell lymphomas and study IGF2BP3 protein expression in 172 well-characterized primary mantle cell lymphomas by immunohistochemistry. The majority of mantle cell lymphoma cell lines and primary cases showed elevated IGF2BP3 mRNA expression and a subset also expressed the IGF1 and IGF2 receptors. On the protein level, 66 of 172 primary mantle cell lymphomas showed IGF2BP3 expression in >50% of tumor cells, and strong IGF2BP3 protein expression was highly associated with increased proliferation as measured by the Ki-67 index, but not with overall survival of mantle cell lymphoma patients. Only a subset of mantle cell lymphomas with marked IGF2BP3 expression had an underlying chromosomal gain in 7p, suggesting that additional mechanisms are involved in the upregulation of IGF2BP3 in mantle cell lymphoma. In seven paired mantle cell lymphoma samples, IGF2BP3 protein expression remained constant between primary diagnosis and relapse. Increased IGF2BP3 expression and, potentially, enhanced IGF signaling may contribute proproliferative stimuli in the evolution of mantle cell lymphoma tumor cells.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Mantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive, non-curable B-cell lymphoma, characterized by the translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) involving CCND1 and a high number of additional genetic alterations.\"]}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant.

The thymus is critical for central tolerance and diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire development, to provide lifelong defense against pathogens while maintaining self-tolerance. Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Necroptosis is a form of caspase-independent programmed cell death that arises from disruption of cell membranes by the mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) pseudokinase after its activation by the upstream kinases, receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-1 and RIPK3, within a complex known as the necrosome. Dysregulated necroptosis has been implicated in numerous inflammatory pathologies. As such, new small molecule necroptosis inhibitors are of great interest, particularly ones that operate downstream of MLKL activation, where the pathway is less well defined. To better understand the mechanisms involved in necroptosis downstream of MLKL activation, and potentially uncover new targets for inhibition, we screened known kinase inhibitors against an activated mouse MLKL mutant, leading us to identify the lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck) inhibitor AMG-47a as an inhibitor of necroptosis. We show that AMG-47a interacts with both RIPK1 and RIPK3, that its ability to protect from cell death is dependent on the strength of the necroptotic stimulus, and that it blocks necroptosis most effectively in human cells. Moreover, in human cell lines, we demonstrate that AMG-47a can protect against cell death caused by forced dimerisation of MLKL truncation mutants in the absence of any upstream signalling, validating that it targets a process downstream of MLKL activation. Surprisingly, however, we also found that the cell death driven by activated MLKL in this model was completely dependent on the presence of RIPK1, and to a lesser extent RIPK3, although it was not affected by known inhibitors of these kinases. Together, these results suggest an additional role for RIPK1, or the necrosome, in mediating human necroptosis after MLKL is phosphorylated by RIPK3 and provide further insight into reported differences in the progression of necroptosis between mouse and human cells.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Necroptosis is a form of caspase-independent programmed cell death that arises from disruption of cell membranes by the mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) pseudokinase after its activation by the upstream kinases, receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-1 and RIPK3, within a complex known as the necrosome\", \"Necroptosis is a form of caspase-independent programmed cell death that arises from disruption of cell membranes by the mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) pseudokinase after its activation by the upstream kinases, receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-1 and RIPK3, within a complex known as the necrosome.\"]}"}]}

Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Viltolarsen is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (PMO) designed to skip exon 53 of the DMD gene\u00a0for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), one of the most common lethal genetic disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of skeletal muscles and cardiomyopathy. It was developed by Nippon Shinyaku in collaboration with\u00a0the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry (NCNP)\u00a0in Japan based on the preclinical studies conducted in the DMD\u00a0dog model at the NCNP. After showing hopeful results in pre-clinical trials and several clinical trials across North America and Japan, it received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for DMD\u00a0in 2020. Viltolarsen restores the reading frame of the DMD gene by skipping \u00a0exon 53\u00a0and produces a truncated but functional form of dystrophin. It can treat approximately 8-10% of the DMD patient population.\u00a0This paper aims to summarize the development of viltolarsen from preclinical trials to clinical trials to, finally, FDA approval, and discusses the challenges that come with fighting DMD using antisense therapy.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Viltolarsen is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (PMO) designed to skip exon 53 of the DMD gene\\u00c2\\u00a0for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)\", \"Viltolarsen restores the reading frame of the DMD gene by skipping \\u00c2\\u00a0exon 53\\u00c2\\u00a0and produces a truncated but functional form of dystrophin. \", \"After showing hopeful results in pre-clinical trials and several clinical trials across North America and Japan, it received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for DMD\\u00c2\\u00a0in 2020.\", \"Viltolarsen restores the reading frame of the DMD gene by skipping \\u00c2\\u00a0exon 53\\u00c2\\u00a0and produces a truncated but functional form of dystrophin.\"]}"}]}

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the prototype of primary humoral immunodeficiencies. Long-term follow-up studies regarding disease-related complications and outcome are scarce. Our aim was to describe the natural history of XLA. A nationwide multicenter study based on the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry was established in 2000 in Italy. Affected patients were enrolled by documenting centers, and the patients' laboratory, clinical, and imaging data were recorded on an annual base. Data on the patients (N\u00a0= 168) were derived from a cumulative follow-up of 1370 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 8.35 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis decreased after establishment of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry (84 months before vs 23 months after). Respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent clinical symptoms at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Regular immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduced the incidence of invasive infections. Affected patients developed chronic lung disease over time (47% after 40 years of follow-up) in the presence of chronic sinusitis (84%). Malignancies were documented in a minority of cases (3.7%). Overall survival for affected patients was significantly reduced when compared with that for the healthy male Italian population, and it further deteriorated in the presence of chronic lung disease. This is the first detailed long-term follow-up study for patients with XLA, revealing that although immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduces the incidence of invasive infections, it does not appear to influence the development of chronic lung disease. The overall survival of affected patients is reduced. Further studies are warranted to improve patients' clinical management and increase awareness among physicians.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The aim of our study was to assess a large cohort of ambulant boys affected by DMD using both North Star Assessment and 6-minute walk test. More specifically, we wished to establish the spectrum of findings for each measure and their correlation. This is a prospective multicentric study involving 10 centers. The cohort included 112 ambulant DMD boys of age ranging between 4.10 and 17 years (mean 8.18\u00b12.3 DS). Ninety-one of the 112 were on steroids: 37/91 on intermittent and 54/91 on daily regimen. The scores on the North Star assessment ranged from 6/34 to 34/34. The distance on the 6-minute walk test ranged from 127 to 560.6 m. The time to walk 10 m was between 3 and 15 s. The time to rise from the floor ranged from 1 to 27.5 s. Some patients were unable to rise from the floor. As expected the results changed with age and were overall better in children treated with daily steroids. The North Star assessment had a moderate to good correlation with 6-minute walk test and with timed rising from floor but less with 10 m timed walk/run test. The 6-minute walk test in contrast had better correlation with 10 m timed walk/run test than with timed rising from floor. These findings suggest that a combination of these outcome measures can be effectively used in ambulant DMD boys and will provide information on different aspects of motor function, that may not be captured using a single measure.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The North Star Ambulatory Assessment is a functional scale specifically designed for ambulant boys affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).\"]}"}]}

Anemia is a frequent comorbidity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with a considerable burden because of decreased patient health-related quality of life and increased healthcare resource utilization. Based on observational data, anemia is associated with an increased risk of CKD progression, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality. The current standard of care includes oral or intravenous iron supplementation, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and red blood cell transfusion. However, each of these therapies has its own set of population-specific patient concerns, including increased risk of cardiovascular disease, thrombosis, and mortality. Patients receiving dialysis or those who have concurrent diabetes or high blood pressure may be at greater risk of developing these complications. In particular, treatment with high doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents has been associated with increased rates of hospitalization, cardiovascular events, and mortality. Resistance to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents remains a therapeutic challenge in a subset of patients. Hypoxia-inducible factor transcription factors, which regulate several genes involved in erythropoiesis and iron metabolism, can be stabilized by a new class of drugs that act as inhibitors of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-hydroxylase enzymes to promote erythropoiesis and elevate hemoglobin levels. Here, we review the burden of anemia of chronic kidney disease, the shortcomings of current standard of care, and the potential practical advantages of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors in the treatment of patients with anemia of CKD.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"f Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease: Beyond Erythropoietin\", \"nemia is a frequent comorbidity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) \"]}"}]}

Patients with CKD can have anemia for many reasons, including but not invariably their renal insufficiency. These patients require a thorough evaluation to identify and correct causes of anemia other than erythropoietin deficiency. The mainstay of treatment of anemia secondary to CKD has become erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). The use of ESAs does carry risks and these agents need to be used judiciously.

In many species, germ cells form in a specialized germ plasm, which contains localized maternal RNAs. In the absence of active transcription in early germ cells, these maternal RNAs encode germ-cell components with critical functions in germ-cell specification, migration, and development. For several RNAs, localization has been correlated with release from translational repression, suggesting an important regulatory function linked to localization. To address the role of RNA localization and translational control more systematically, we assembled a comprehensive set of RNAs that are localized to polar granules, the characteristic germ-plasm organelles. We find that the 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of all RNAs tested control RNA localization and instruct distinct temporal patterns of translation of the localized RNAs. We demonstrate necessity for translational timing by swapping the 3'UTR of polar granule component (pgc), which controls translation in germ cells, with that of nanos, which is translated earlier.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most severe childhood form of muscular dystrophy caused by mutations in the gene responsible for dystrophin production. There is no cure, and treatment is limited to glucocorticoids that prolong ambulation and drugs to treat the cardiomyopathy. Multiple treatment strategies are under investigation and have shown promise for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Use of molecular-based therapies that replace or correct the missing or nonfunctional dystrophin protein has gained momentum. These strategies include gene replacement with adeno-associated virus, exon skipping with antisense oligonucleotides, and mutation suppression with compounds that \"read through\" stop codon mutations. Other strategies include cell therapy and surrogate gene products to compensate for the loss of dystrophin. All of these approaches are discussed in this review, with particular emphasis on the most recent advances made in each therapeutic discipline. The advantages of each approach and challenges in translation are outlined in detail. Individually or in combination, all of these therapeutic strategies hold great promise for treatment of this devastating childhood disease.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"These strategies include gene replacement with adeno-associated virus, exon skipping with antisense oligonucleotides, and mutation suppression with compounds that \\\"read through\\\" stop codon mutations.\"]}"}]}

Predictive modeling with electronic health record (EHR) data is anticipated to drive personalized medicine and improve healthcare quality. Constructing predictive statistical models typically requires extraction of curated predictor variables from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive process that discards the vast majority of information in each patient's record. We propose a representation of patients' entire raw EHR records based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. We demonstrate that deep learning methods using this representation are capable of accurately predicting multiple medical events from multiple centers without site-specific data harmonization. We validated our approach using de-identified EHR data from two US academic medical centers with 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at least 24\u2009h. In the sequential format we propose, this volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945 data points, including clinical notes. Deep learning models achieved high accuracy for tasks such as predicting: in-hospital mortality (area under the receiver operator curve [AUROC] across sites 0.93-0.94), 30-day unplanned readmission (AUROC 0.75-0.76), prolonged length of stay (AUROC 0.85-0.86), and all of a patient's final discharge diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90). These models outperformed traditional, clinically-used predictive models in all cases.

Improving predictive models for intensive care unit (ICU) inpatients requires a new strategy that periodically includes the latest clinical data and can be updated to reflect local characteristics. We extracted data from all adult patients admitted to the ICUs of two university hospitals with different characteristics from 2006 to 2020, and a total of 85,146 patients were included in this study. Machine learning algorithms were trained to predict in-hospital mortality. The predictive performance of conventional scoring models and machine learning algorithms was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The conventional scoring models had various predictive powers, with the SAPS III (AUROC 0.773 [0.766-0.779] for hospital S) and APACHE III (AUROC 0.803 [0.795-0.810] for hospital G) showing the highest AUROC among them. The best performing machine learning models achieved an AUROC of 0.977 (0.973-0.980) in hospital S and 0.955 (0.950-0.961) in hospital G. The use of ML models in conjunction with conventional scoring systems can provide more useful information for predicting the prognosis of critically ill patients.

In this review article we provide a critical insight into recent reports evaluating innovative therapies for warm type autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA). Among published articles, we selected two reports on the use of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in association with dexamethasone or rituximab, one study on the spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor fostamatinib, and a retrospective study on recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO). Among recent scientific communications, we discussed a report on the phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta inhibitor (PI3K\u03b4i) parsaclisib. All studies highlighted a good efficacy although to be confirmed in larger trials and with limitations due to the heterogeneity of wAIHA patients enrolled, the small number of subjects, the concomitant medications allowed, and the short follow-up. Ongoing trials include new B-cell/plasma-cell targeting agents such as the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors ibrutinib and rilzabrutinib, and the anti-CD38 MoAbs daratumumab and its analogue isatuximab. Further drugs in clinical trials target the complement cascade in wAIHA with complement activation, such as the C3 inhibitor pegcetacoplan and the C1q inhibitor ANX005. Finally, an interesting and non-immuno-toxic strategy is to remove the pathogenic autoantibodies via blocking the neonatal Fc receptor, by intravenous nipocalimab and subcutaneous RVT-1401. Such novel agents targeting the several immunopathological mechanisms acting in wAIHA and their possible combination, will increase the therapeutic armamentarium and possibly fill the gap of wAIHA relapsed after/refractory to rituximab. Moreover, these new target therapies may represent a tool for the unmet need of very acute cases.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Ongoing trials include new B-cell/plasma-cell targeting agents such as the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors ibrutinib and rilzabrutinib, and the anti-CD38 MoAbs daratumumab and its analogue isatuximab. \"]}"}]}

Cereblon, an extensively studied multifunctional protein, is a Cullin 4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex component. Cereblon is a well-known target of thalidomide and its derivatives. Cereblon is involved in multiple myeloma cell apoptosis. When ligands such as thalidomide and lenalidomide bind to cereblon, it recognizes various neosubstrates based on the ligand shape and properties. We have identified novel CRBN inhibitors, namely DHFO and its analogs, with structural features that are slightly different from thalidomide but stronger cereblon-binding affinity. We selected indanedione and indanone derivatives from the literature to understand and compare their cereblon-mediated substrate recognition potential. Computational investigations of possible CRBN inhibitors were investigated by molecular docking with Autodock Vina and DockThor programs. The properties of the compounds' ADME/T and drug-likeness were investigated. A molecular dynamics study was carried out for four selected molecules, and the molecular interactions were analyzed using PCA-based FEL methods. The binding affinity was calculated using the MM/PBSA method. We conducted computational investigations on 68 indanedione and indanone derivatives binding with cereblon. Ten molecules showed better CRBN binding affinity than thalidomide. We studied the drug-likeness properties of the selected ten molecules, and four of the most promising molecules (DHFO, THOH, DIMS, and DTIN) were chosen for molecular dynamics studies. The MM/PBSA calculations showed that the DHFO, already shown to be a 5-LOX/COX2 inhibitor, has the highest binding affinity of -\u00a0163.16\u00a0kJ/mol with cereblon. The selected CRBN inhibitor DHFO has demonstrated the highest binding affinity with cereblon protein compared to other molecules. Thalidomide and its derivatives have a new substitute in the form of DHFO, which produces an interaction hotspot on the surface of the cereblon. Ease of chemical synthesis, low toxicity, versatile therapeutic options, and pleiotropism of DHFO analogs provide an opportunity for exploring clinical alternatives with versatile therapeutic potential for a new category of indanedione molecules as novel modulators of E3 ubiquitin ligases.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Cereblon is a well-known target of thalidomide and its derivatives.\", \"We have identified novel CRBN inhibitors, namely DHFO and its analogs, with structural features that are slightly different from thalidomide but stronger cereblon-binding affinity. \", \"ubiquitin ligase complex component.

To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Carvedilol suppressed apoptosis of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC through modification of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, whose was associated with an increase of Cav 1.2 protein expression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Cytochrome P450 1A1 is a major enzyme in the bioactivation of exogenous procarcinogens of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the contribution of common genetic variants in CYP1A1 to the HCC risk in Chinese populations has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we examined the association between HCC and four selected tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP1A1, and the risk of CYP1A1 haplotypes/diplotypes in 1006 pathologically confirmed HCC patients and 1015 cancer-free controls, from a Han Chinese population. Haplotypes/diplotypes were constructed from observed genotypes using the Haplo.Stats program. Relative risk was estimated by using multivariable logistic regression method. To summarise, we detected an increased HCC risk in rs4646421 variant carriers (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.61) and rs2198843 variant carriers (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.69), and a reduced risk of HCC (OR 0.70. 95% CI 0.52-0.94) associated with homozygote carriers of rs4886605 variant. These association signals were also observed in non-smokers with rs4646421 (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.16-2.08) and rs4886605 (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.91). Compared to the most common CYP1A1 haplotype CCAG, the haplotype TTGC conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.52). Similarly, the TTGC/TTGC diplotype conferred an increased risk of HCC compared with diplotype CCAG/CCAG (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.23-3.45, P=0.006). Interestingly, the diplotype TTAC/CCAG also conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.22-2.54, P=0.003). Our results suggested that common genetic variants in CYP1A1 may modulate the risk of developing HCC in the study population, particularly in non-smokers. However, our findings need to be validated in at least one independent study of Han Chinese population.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Idiopathic anaphylaxis is a condition caused by paroxysmal episodes of sudden-onset multiorgan involvement variably including laryngeal edema, urticaria, bronchoconstriction, dyspnea, hypoxia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension. Rarely, the episodes can lead to cardiovascular collapse and death in the absence of a clear trigger, especially in the presence of other cardiovascular comorbidities. Elevated mast cell mediators such as tryptase and histamine have been reported during episodes, and mast cells are considered the primary cells responsible for driving anaphylaxis in humans. Basophils also secrete histamine and LTC4 when activated and theoretically can contribute to symptoms. As our understanding of mast cell disorders continue to grow, the classification for these disorders evolves.

Disease prevalence is rarely explicitly considered in the early stages of the development of novel prognostic tests. Rather, researchers use the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) as the key metric to gauge and report predictive performance ability. Because this statistic does not account for disease prevalence, proposed tests may not appropriately address clinical requirements. This ultimately impedes the translation of prognostic tests into clinical practice. A method to express positive- and/or negative predictive value criteria (PPV, NPV) within the ROC space is presented. Equations are derived for so-called equi-PPV (and equi-NPV) lines. Herewith it is possible, for any given prevalence, to plot a series of sensitivity-specificity pairs which meet a specified PPV (or NPV) criterion onto the ROC space.This concept is introduced by firstly reviewing the well-established \"mechanics\", strengths and limitations of the ROC analysis in the context of developing prognostic models. Then, the use of PPV (and/or) NPV criteria to augment the ROC analysis is elaborated.Additionally, an interactive web tool was also created to enable people to explore the dynamics of lines of equi-predictive value in function of prevalence. The web tool also allows to gauge what ROC curve shapes best meet specific positive and/or negative predictive value criteria (http://d4ta.link/ppvnpv/). To illustrate the merits and implications of this concept, an example on the prediction of pre-eclampsia risk in low-risk nulliparous pregnancies is elaborated. In risk stratification, the clinical usefulness of a prognostic test can be expressed in positive- and negative predictive value criteria; the development of novel prognostic tests will be facilitated by the possibility to co-visualise such criteria together with ROC curves.\u00a0To achieve clinically meaningful risk stratification, the development of separate tests to meet either a pre-specified positive value (rule-in) or a negative predictive value (rule-out) criteria should be considered: the characteristics of successful rule-in and rule-out tests may markedly differ.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"stic tests.

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The thymus is critical for central tolerance and diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire development, to provide lifelong defense against pathogens while maintaining self-tolerance. Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Systemic anaphylaxis arises when mast cells, possibly along with other cell types, are provoked to secrete mediators that evoke a systemic response. Mast cells in perivascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal and cutaneous tissues are likely involved, regardless of whether IgE or non-IgE-dependent pathways are invoked. Alpha/beta tryptases are selectively and abundantly produced by mast cells. Tryptase levels in the circulation provide a precise indicator of mast cell involvement. Mature beta tryptase is stored in secretory granules and is released when the cells are activated to degranulate, as occurs in anaphylaxis. Alpha/beta pro/pro' tryptases are spontaneously secreted by mast cells. Consequently, mature tryptase levels in serum (normally 1 ng/ml) are elevated in systemic anaphylaxis. Total tryptase levels (mature plus precursor forms), normally 1-15 ng/ml in baseline serum samples, are elevated in patients with systemic mastocytosis (> 20 ng/ml), a disease that also predisposes one to anaphylactic reactions. The assessment of basophils in systemic anaphylactic reactions has been problematic, because an assay for a specific releasable marker from this cell type has not been developed. Nevertheless, in cases of anaphylaxis in which elevations of histamine, but not tryptase, have been detected, it is enticing to speculate that basophil-dependent anaphylaxis may have occurred.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Systemic anaphylaxis arises when mast cells, possibly along with other cell types, are provoked to secrete mediators that evoke a systemic response.\"]}"}]}

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the prototype of primary humoral immunodeficiencies. Long-term follow-up studies regarding disease-related complications and outcome are scarce. Our aim was to describe the natural history of XLA. A nationwide multicenter study based on the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry was established in 2000 in Italy. Affected patients were enrolled by documenting centers, and the patients' laboratory, clinical, and imaging data were recorded on an annual base. Data on the patients (N\u00a0= 168) were derived from a cumulative follow-up of 1370 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 8.35 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis decreased after establishment of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry (84 months before vs 23 months after). Respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent clinical symptoms at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Regular immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduced the incidence of invasive infections. Affected patients developed chronic lung disease over time (47% after 40 years of follow-up) in the presence of chronic sinusitis (84%). Malignancies were documented in a minority of cases (3.7%). Overall survival for affected patients was significantly reduced when compared with that for the healthy male Italian population, and it further deteriorated in the presence of chronic lung disease. This is the first detailed long-term follow-up study for patients with XLA, revealing that although immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduces the incidence of invasive infections, it does not appear to influence the development of chronic lung disease.

Anaphylaxis is a notorious type 2 immune response which may result in a systemic response and lead to death. A precondition for the unfolding of the anaphylactic shock is the secretion of inflammatory mediators from mast cells in response to an allergen, mostly through activation of the cells via the IgE-dependent pathway. While mast cells are specialized secretory cells that can secrete through a variety of exocytic modes, the most predominant mode exerted by the mast cell during anaphylaxis is compound exocytosis-a specialized form of regulated exocytosis where secretory granules fuse to one another. Here, we review the modes of regulated exocytosis in the mast cell and focus on compound exocytosis. We review historical landmarks in the research of compound exocytosis in mast cells and the methods available for investigating compound exocytosis. We also review the molecular mechanisms reported to underlie compound exocytosis in mast cells and expand further with reviewing key findings from other cell types. Finally, we discuss the possible reasons for the mast cell to utilize compound exocytosis during anaphylaxis, the conflicting evidence in different mast cell models, and the open questions in the field which remain to be answered.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Anaphylactic Degranulation of Mast Cells: Focus on Compound Exocytosis.\", \" A precondition for the unfolding of the anaphylactic shock is the secretion of inflammatory mediators from mast cells in response to an allergen, mostly through activation of the cells via the IgE-dependent pathway.\", \" types.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by the mutations in the DMD gene resulting in no dystrophin production. Skipping DMD exons using phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) is an emerging treatment strategy that can restore the reading frame of the mutated gene and produce truncated but functional dystrophin protein. To date, four PMOs, including eteplirsen, casimersen, viltolarsen, and golodirsen, have been conditionally approved by the FDA for the treatment of DMD. Since degeneration of muscle fibers and irreversible fibrosis occur from childhood, the earlier treatment is preferred. The canine X-linked muscular dystrophy in Japan (CXMDj), a dog model of DMD, produces no dystrophin and exhibits a severe phenotype similar to human patients from early childhood. As such, CXMDj, which harbors\u00a0a splice site mutation in intron 6, is a useful model for examining the long-term effects of early PMO treatment. In this chapter, we describe the systemic delivery of a cocktail of four PMOs that can successfully induce multiple exon skipping (exons 6-9) in neonatal\u00a0dystrophic dogs. We also describe the procedures to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity, including clinical grading of dystrophic dogs, ELISA-based quantification of PMOs, histology, RT-PCR, and western blotting.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"To date, four PMOs, including eteplirsen, casimersen, viltolarsen, and golodirsen, have been conditionally approved by the FDA for the treatment of DMD.\"]}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

Anemia is a frequent complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and it is often accompanied by various clinical symptoms. The primary cause of anemia in CKD patients is the reduction in the erythropoietin production, which results in a decrease of signaling molecule that stimulates red blood cell production. Other possible causes of anemia in CKD include iron deficiency, inflammation, and the accumulation of uremic toxin. This chapter focuses the discussion on the strategy of the management of anemia in patients with CKD. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and adjuvant iron therapy represent the primary treatment for anemia in chronic kidney disease. The introduction of ESAs into clinical practice was a success goal, mediating an increase in hemoglobin concentrations without the risk for recurrent blood transfusions and improving quality of life substantially.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Anemia is a frequent complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and it is often accompanied by various clinical symptoms.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes.

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Machine learning was a highly effective tool in model construction. We aim to establish a machine learning-based predictive model for predicting the cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC). We obtained data on PTMC from the SEER database, including 10 demographic and clinicopathological characteristics. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression (LR) analyses were applied to screen the risk factors for cervical LNM in PTMC. Risk factors with P\u2009<\u20090.05 in multivariate LR analysis were used as modeling variables. Five different machine learning (ML) algorithms including extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gaussian naive bayes (GNB) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and traditional regression analysis were used to construct the prediction model. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to compare the model performance. Through univariate and multivariate LR analysis, we screened out 9 independent risk factors most closely associated with cervical LNM in PTMC, including age, sex, race, marital status, region, histology, tumor size, and extrathyroidal extension (ETE) and multifocality. We used these risk factors to build an ML prediction model, in which the AUROC value of the XGBoost algorithm was higher than the other 4 ML algorithms and was the best ML model. We optimized the XGBoost algorithm through 10-fold cross-validation, and its best performance on the training set (AUROC: 0.809, 95%CI 0.800-0.818) was better than traditional LR analysis (AUROC: 0.780, 95%CI 0.772-0.787).

Based on very high response rates in the relapsed and refractory setting, brentuximab vedotin and the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have quickly been incorporated into clinical trials for first- and second-line therapy of Hodgkin lymphoma. Preliminary data show that brentuximab vedotin alone is not adequate therapy for newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma in older patients, but modestly decreases the risk of relapse when combined with adriamycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine in patients with previously untreated advanced-stage disease. In second-line therapy, combining brentuximab vedotin with conventional chemotherapy or with PD-1 inhibitors as pretransplant salvage is associated with high overall and complete response rates, although further follow up is needed to assess whether posttransplant outcomes are improved. Although these new drugs are well tolerated when given as single agents, unexpected toxicities have been encountered with combination regimens, specifically severe pulmonary toxicity with the bleomycin and brentuximab vedotin combination and frequent infusion-related reactions. There is concern with the use of PD-1 inhibitors as first-line therapy due to the theoretical potential for more frequent or severe immune-mediated toxicities in patients who have not received prior chemotherapy.

This retrospective study included patients with SFTS and JSF treated at five hospitals in Nagasaki Prefecture, western Japan, between 2013 and 2020. Data from 23 patients with SFTS and 38 patients with JSF were examined for differentiating factors and were divided by 7:3 into a training cohort and a validation cohort. Decision tree analysis revealed leukopenia (white blood cell [WBC] < 4000/\u03bcL) and altered mental status as the best differentiating factors (AUC 1.000) with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Using only physical examination factors, absence of skin rash and altered mental status resulted in the best differentiating factors with AUC 0.871, 71.4% sensitivity, and 90.0% specificity. When treating patients with suspected tick-borne infection, WBC < 4000/\u00b5L, absence of skin rash, and altered mental status are very useful to differentiate SFTS from JSF.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) and Japanese spotted fever (JSF; a spotted fever group rickettsiosis) are tick-borne zoonoses that are becoming a significant public health threat in Japan and East Asia.\"]}"}]}

The patients had a lifetime impairment in recognizing faces of family members, close friends, and even her own face in photos. She also had impairment in recognizing animals such as discriminating between cats and dogs. The patient's basic visual skills showed impairment in identifying and recognizing the animal form perception on the coding subtest of the WAIS-R, recognizing overlapping pictures (Luria), and in identifying silhouettes depicting animals and objects (VOSP). Unconventional tests using pictures evidenced impairment in her capacity to identify famous faces, facial emotions and animals.

Superior mesenteric artery syndrome, or Wilkie's syndrome, is an unexpected cause of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. The exact incidence of the condition remains unknown, and limited case reports are present in the literature. The obstruction results in the compression of the third part of the duodenum between the superior mesenteric artery and aorta. It is widely known that a lack of subcutaneous tissue in the area can precipitate the obstruction by significantly reducing the aortomesenteric angle. Wilkie's syndrome presents a clinically diagnostic challenge as patients initially remain undiagnosed with relapsing episodes of upper abdominal pain and bilious vomiting. In some cases, an acute obstruction may arise. Undertaking an initial contrast study of the upper gastrointestinal tract and a CT scan are required to confirm the diagnosis of the condition. In the present study, we elucidate the case of a 12-year-old girl who presented with upper abdominal pain and bouts of bilious vomiting. Upon extensive diagnostic evaluation, Wilkie's syndrome was diagnosed. Since the patient failed to respond to conservative treatment, a laparotomy with subsequent duodenojejunostomy was undertaken. The postoperative recovery of the patient was uneventful with no recurrence of symptoms on follow-up.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Superior mesenteric artery syndrome, or Wilkie's syndrome, is an unexpected cause of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction. \"]}"}]}

Considering the Role of MRGPRX2 in Acute Drug-Induced Anaphylaxis and as a Therapeutic Target. Acute anaphylaxis to small molecule drugs is largely considered to be antibody-mediated with immunogloblin E (IgE) and mast cell activation being key. More recently, a role for drug-reactive immunoglobulin G (IgG) with neutrophil activation has also been suggested, at least in reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). However, the mast cell receptor MRGPRX2 has also been highlighted as a possible triggering mechanism in acute anaphylaxis to many clinically used drugs. Significantly, MRGPRX2 activation is not dependent upon the presence of drug-recognising antibody. Given the reasonable assumption that MRGPRX2 is expressed in all individuals, the corollary of this is that in theory, anybody could respond detrimentally to triggering drugs (recently suggested to be around 20% of a drug-like compound library). But this clearly is not the case, as the incidence of acute drug-induced anaphylaxis is very low. In this mini-review we consider antibody-dependent and -independent mechanisms of mast cell activation by small molecule drugs with a focus on the MRGPRX2 pathway. Moreover, as a juxtaposition to these adverse drug actions, we consider how increased understanding of the role of MRGPRX2 in anaphylaxis is important for future drug development and can complement exploration of this receptor as a drug target in broader clinical settings.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Acute anaphylaxis to small molecule drugs is largely considered to be antibody-mediated with immunogloblin E (IgE) and mast cell activation being key.\"]}"}]}

CDK9 is a prominent member of the transcriptional CDKs subfamily, a group of kinases whose function is to control the primary steps of mRNA synthesis and processing by eukaryotic RNA polymerase II. As a cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK9 activation in vivo depends upon its association with T-type cyclins to assemble the positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb). Although CDK9/P-TEFb phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNAP II in the same positions targeted by CDK7 (TFIIH) and CDK8 (Mediator), the former does not participate in the transcription initiation, but rather plays a unique role by driving the polymerase to productive elongation. In addition to RNAP II CTD, the negative transcription elongation factors DSIF and NELF also represent major CDK9 substrates, whose phosphorylation is required to overcome the proximal pause of the polymerase. CDK9 is recruited to specific genes through proteins that interact with both P-TEFb and distinct elements in DNA, RNA or chromatin, where it modulates the activity of individual RNAP II transcription complexes. The regulation of CDK9 function is an intricate network that includes post-translational modifications (phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and acetylation/deacetylation of key residues) as well as the association of P-TEFb with various proteins that can stimulate or inhibit its kinase activity. Several cases of CDK9 deregulation have been linked to important human diseases, including various types of cancer and also AIDS (due to its essential role in HIV replication). Not only HIV, but also many other human viruses have been shown to depend strongly on CDK9 activity to be transcribed within host cells. This review summarizes the main advances made on CDK9/P-TEFb field in more than 20 years, introducing the structural, functional and genetic aspects that have been elucidated ever since.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"CDK9 is a prominent member of the transcriptional CDKs subfamily, a group of kinases whose function is to control the primary steps of mRNA synthesis and processing by eukaryotic RNA polymerase II.\", \"CDK9 is a prominent member of the transcriptional CDKs subfamily, a group of kinases whose function is to control the primary steps of mRNA synthesis and processing by eukaryotic RNA polymerase II.

Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition characterized by rapid hair loss in the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes, for which treatments are limited. Baricitinib, an oral, selective, reversible inhibitor of Janus kinases 1 and 2, may interrupt cytokine signaling implicated in the pathogenesis of alopecia areata. We conducted two randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials (BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2) involving adults with severe alopecia areata with a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score of 50 or higher (range, 0 [no scalp hair loss] to 100 [complete scalp hair loss]). Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2:2 ratio to receive once-daily baricitinib at a dose of 4 mg, baricitinib at a dose of 2 mg, or placebo. The primary outcome was a SALT score of 20 or less at week 36. We enrolled 654 patients in the BRAVE-AA1 trial and 546 in the BRAVE-AA2 trial. The estimated percentage of patients with a SALT score of 20 or less at week 36 was 38.8% with 4-mg baricitinib, 22.8% with 2-mg baricitinib, and 6.2% with placebo in BRAVE-AA1 and 35.9%, 19.4%, and 3.3%, respectively, in BRAVE-AA2. In BRAVE-AA1, the difference between 4-mg baricitinib and placebo was 32.6 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.6 to 39.5), and the difference between 2-mg baricitinib and placebo was 16.6 percentage points (95% CI, 9.5 to 23.8) (P<0.001 for each dose vs. placebo). In BRAVE-AA2, the corresponding values were 32.6 percentage points (95% CI, 25.6 to 39.6) and 16.1 percentage points (95% CI, 9.1 to 23.2) (P<0.001 for each dose vs. placebo). Secondary outcomes for baricitinib at a dose of 4 mg but not at a dose of 2 mg generally favored baricitinib over placebo. Acne, elevated levels of creatine kinase, and increased levels of low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were more common with baricitinib than with placebo. In two phase 3 trials involving patients with severe alopecia areata, oral baricitinib was superior to placebo with respect to hair regrowth at 36 weeks. Longer trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of baricitinib for alopecia areata.

Diffuse gliomas are among the most common adult central nervous system tumors with an annual incidence of more than 16,000 cases in the United States. Until very recently, the diagnosis of these tumors was based solely on morphologic features, however, with the publication of the WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System, revised 4th edition in 2016, certain molecular features are now included in the official diagnostic and grading system. One of the most significant of these changes has been the division of adult astrocytomas into IDH-wildtype and IDH-mutant categories in addition to histologic grade as part of the main-line diagnosis, although a great deal of heterogeneity in the clinical outcome still remains to be explained within these categories. Since then, numerous groups have been working to identify additional biomarkers and prognostic factors in diffuse gliomas to help further stratify these tumors in hopes of producing a more complete grading system, as well as understanding the underlying biology that results in differing outcomes. The field of neuro-oncology is currently in the midst of a \"molecular revolution\" in which increasing emphasis is being placed on genetic and epigenetic features driving current diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive considerations.

Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

A novel automated chemiluminescence (CL) read-out system for analytical flow-through microarrays based on multiplexed immunoassays has been developed. The microarray chip reader (MCR 3) is designed as a stand-alone platform, with the goal to quantify multiple analytes in complex matrices of food and liquid samples for field analysis or for routine analytical laboratories. The CL microarray platform is a self-contained system for the fully automated multiplexed immunoanalysis: the microarray chip, the fluidic system and the software module enable automated calibration and determination of analyte concentrations during a whole working day. The detection of antibiotics in milk was demonstrated to validate this device. There are few quantitative multi-residue detection methods for routine analysis although the EU has defined maximum residue limits (MRLs) for a number of antibacterial reagents. Therefore, an automated multianalyte detection instrument is needed quantifying simultaneously antibiotics within some minutes. Also regeneration is required to avoid replacing the assay surface. The MCR 3 uses a microarray chip, which consists of two channels for parallel measurement and regeneration. The microarray chip is designed for parallel analysis of up to 13 different antibiotics in milk applying an indirect competitive microarray immunoassay (MIA). Microspotted antibiotics are directly coupled to epoxylated PEG surfaces. As an initial example, penicillin G is quantified in milk on the MCR 3. The penicillin G surface is regenerable for 47 measurement cycles per channel. A limit of detection (LOD) of 1.1 microg/L is achieved by an assay time of 6 min.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The syndrome is associated with a five-fold increased incidence of stillbirth, intra-partum foetal distress and pre-term labour. The reason is not clear and not predictable. The accepted management is induction or delivery at 38 weeks, which has led to a reduction in poor foetal outcome. Preliminary studies using ursodeoxycholic acid show symptomatic and biochemical improvement in most women treated.

Kinases have gained an important place in the list of vital therapeutic targets because of their overwhelming clinical success in the last two decades. Among various clinically validated kinases, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) are one of the extensively studied drug targets for clinical development. Food and Drug Administration has approved three CDK inhibitors for therapeutic use, and at least 27 inhibitors are under active clinical development. In the last decade, research and development in this area took a rapid pace, and thus the analysis of scaffold diversity is essential for future drug design. Available reviews lack the systematic study and discussion on the scaffold diversity of CDK inhibitors. Herein we have reviewed and critically analyzed the chemical diversity present in the preclinical and clinical pipeline of CDK inhibitors. Our analysis has shown that although several scaffolds represent CDK inhibitors, only the amino-pyrimidine is a well-represented scaffold. The three-nitrogen framework of amino-pyrimidine is a fundamental hinge-binding unit. Further, we have discussed the selectivity aspects among CDKs, the clinical trial dose-limiting toxicities, and highlighted the most advanced clinical candidates. We also discuss the changing paradigm towards selective inhibitors and an overview of ATP-binding pockets of all druggable CDKs. We carefully analyzed the clinical pipeline to unravel the candidates that are currently under active clinical development. In addition to the plenty of dual CDK4/6 inhibitors, there are many selective CDK7, CDK9, and CDK8/19 inhibitors in the clinical pipeline.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Among various clinically validated kinases, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) are one of the extensively studied drug targets for clinical developmen\"]}"}]}

Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in predialysis stage. Iron deficiency is more common than in normal patients and plays a key role in the genesis of anemia. Its correction avoids the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) or reduces their dosage. Treatment with oral iron is often poorly tolerated and ineffective, necessitating the use of intravenous iron. New forms of injectable iron allow the use of high doses and correct iron deficiency in a single administration with consequent preservation of venous capital and lower costs. We studied the effectiveness of iron dextran of low molecular weight (LMWID) in high doses to correct iron deficiency and treat anemia in predialysis CKD patients. Twenty-nine doses of 500 to 1600 mg were administered to 25 patients followed for CKD (GFR between 60 and 10 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), selected on biological criteria of iron deficiency defined by a ratio of transferrin saturation (TSAT) <20% and/or serum ferritin of less than 100 \u03bcg/L. Patients received treatment by ESA in 16 cases out of 29. One month after treatment, hemoglobin (Hb) increased significantly (11.4\u00b11.6 vs 10.4\u00b11.4 g/dL, P=0.0003) along with a significant increase in TSAT (21.3\u00b17.3 vs 13.3\u00b13.8%, P=0.000003) and serum ferritin (286\u00b1253 vs 91\u00b160 \u03bcg/L, P=0.00005). Six patients had a serum ferritin greater than 500 \u03bcg/L after treatment, which may put them at risk of iron overload. Their serum ferritin was higher than the rest of the population before treatment, while the TSAT was no different, reflecting a functional deficiency. Their hemoglobin did not increase after treatment in contrast to the rest of the population suggesting the unavailability of iron for erythropoiesis with accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system. Renal function did not change significantly and there were no cases of acute renal failure. No immediate side effect was observed. Three patients presented delayed reactions to such self-limiting myalgia and arthralgia. No venous inflammatory reaction was noted. The administration of high doses of LMWID is effective in treating anemia of CKD in the predialysis stage with a satisfactory tolerance, without affecting kidney function and helps preserve the venous capital. It should be reserved for patients whose serum ferritin is less than or equal to 150 \u03bcg/L.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in predialysis stage.\"]}"}]}

The novel morpholino antisense oligonucleotide viltolarsen targets exon 53 of the dystrophin gene, and could be an effective treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We investigated viltolarsen's ability to induce dystrophin expression and examined its safety in DMD patients. In this open-label, multicenter, parallel-group, phase 1/2, exploratory study, 16 ambulant and nonambulant males aged 5-12\u00a0years with DMD received viltolarsen 40 or 80\u00a0mg/kg/week via intravenous infusion for 24\u00a0weeks. Primary endpoints were dystrophin expression and exon 53 skipping levels. In western blot analysis, mean changes in dystrophin expression (% normal) from baseline to Weeks 12 and 24 were\u00a0-\u00a01.21 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.5136) and 1.46 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.1636), respectively, in the 40\u00a0mg/kg group, and 0.76 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.2367) and 4.81 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0536), respectively, in the 80\u00a0mg/kg group. The increase in mean dystrophin level at Weeks 12 and 24 was significant in the 80\u00a0mg/kg group (2.78%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.0364). Patients receiving 80\u00a0mg/kg showed a higher mean exon 53 skipping level (42.4%) than those receiving 40\u00a0mg/kg (21.8%). All adverse events were judged to be mild or moderate in intensity and none led to study discontinuation. Treatment with viltolarsen 40 or 80\u00a0mg/kg elicited an increasing trend in dystrophin expression and exon 53 skipping levels, and was safe and well tolerated. The decline in motor function appeared less marked in patients with higher dystrophin levels; this may warrant further investigation. This study supports the potential clinical benefit of viltolarsen.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"ucleotide viltolarsen targets exon 53 of the dystrophin gene, and could be an effective treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).\"]}"}]}

Whether high D-dimer level before treatment has any impact on poor outcomes in patients with community-associated pneumonia (CAP) remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted the first meta-analysis focusing specifically on prognostic value of high D-dimer level before treatment in CAP patients. Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and World Health Organization clinical trials registry center were searched up to the end of March 2021. Randomized clinical trials (RCT) and observational studies were included to demonstrate the association between the level of D-dimer and clinical outcomes. Data were extracted using an adaptation of the Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modeling Studies (CHARMS-PF). When feasible, meta-analysis using random-effects models was performed. Risk of bias and level of evidence were assessed with the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool and an adaptation of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Data were analyzed using STATA 14.0 to complete meta and network analysis. Besides d-dimer levels in CAP patients with poor outcomes, we also analyzed proportion of patients with or without poor outcomes correctly classified by the d-dimer levels as being at high or low risk. The poor outcome includes severe CAP, death, pulmonary embolism (PE) and invasive mechanical ventilators. 32 studies with a total of 9,593 patients were eventually included. Pooled effect size (ES) suggested that d-dimer level was significantly higher in severe CAP patients than non-severe CAP patients with great heterogeneity (SMD = 1.21 95%CI 0.87-1.56, I2 = 86.8% p = 0.000). D-dimer level was significantly elevated in non-survivors compared to survivors with CAP (SMD = 1.22 95%CI 0.67-1.77, I2 = 85.1% p = 0.000). Prognostic value of d-dimer for pulmonary embolism (PE) was proved by hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve (HSROC) with good summary sensitivity (0.74, 95%CI, 0.50-0.89) and summary specificity (0.82, 95%CI, 0.41-0.97). Network meta-analysis suggested that there was a significant elevation of d-dimer levels in CAP patients with poor outcome than general CAP patients but d-dimer levels weren't significantly different among poor outcomes. The prognostic ability of d-dimer among patients with CAP appeared to be good at correctly identifying high-risk populations of poor outcomes, suggesting potential for clinical utility in patients with CAP.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modeling Studies (CHARMS-PF).\"]}"}]}

However, limited information about the role of TROAP in LAC is available. We evaluated the relationship of TROAP expression in LAC tissues with clinical pathologic parameters and the survival time in LAC patients based on a statistical analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung cancer data (N=528). Differences in survival between high and low expression groups (median expression cutoff) from the Cox univariate/multivariate regression analysis were then compared. According to the Chi-square tests, we found high TROAP expression correlated with younger age (\u226460) (P=0.047), male sex (P<0.005), an earlier T-stage (P=0.011), N-stage (P=0.017), M-stage (P=0.022), TNM (P=0.007), and a longer smoking history (>30 pack-year) (P<0.001).

Anaphylaxis is a rapidly developing, life-threatening, generalized or systemic allergic reaction that is classically elicited by antigen crosslinking of antigen-specific IgE bound to the high-affinity IgE receptor Fc\u03b5RI on mast cells and basophils. This initiates signals that induce cellular degranulation with release and secretion of vasoactive mediators, enzymes, and cytokines. However, IgE-independent mechanisms of anaphylaxis have been clearly demonstrated in experimental animals. These include IgG-dependent anaphylaxis, which involves the triggering of mediator release by IgG/antigen complex crosslinking of Fc\u03b3Rs on macrophages, basophils, and neutrophils; anaphylaxis mediated by binding of the complement-derived peptides C3a and C5a to their receptors on mast cells, basophils, and other myeloid cells; and direct activation of mast cells by drugs that interact with receptors on these cells. Here we review the mechanisms involved in these IgE-independent forms of anaphylaxis and the clinical evidence for their human relevance. We conclude that this evidence supports the existence of all 3 IgE-independent mechanisms as important causes of human disease, although practical and ethical considerations preclude their demonstration to the degree of certainty possible with animal models. Furthermore, we cite evidence that different clinical situations can suggest different mechanisms as having a primal role in anaphylaxis and that IgE-dependent and distinct IgE-independent mechanisms can act together to increase anaphylaxis severity. As specific agents become available that can interfere with mechanisms involved in the different types of anaphylaxis, recognition of specific types of anaphylaxis is likely to become important for optimal prophylaxis and therapy.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Anaphylaxis is a rapidly developing, life-threatening, generalized or systemic allergic reaction that is classically elicited by antigen crosslinking of antigen-specific IgE bound to the high-affinity IgE receptor Fc\\u00ce\\u00b5RI on mast cells and basophils.\"]}"}]}

Iron deficiency, both functional and absolute, is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those requiring dialysis. Guidelines advocate treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with CKD and those on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Oral iron is often insufficient and slow to improve hemoglobin concentrations because of high hepcidin levels causing impaired absorption and mobilization, while intravenous (IV) supplementation replenishes and maintains iron stores more effectively and is now standard practice (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] 2012 guidelines). However, there still remain concerns about the effects of labile iron and possible increased risk of infections for this group of patients.To date, the majority of published studies have focused on hemodialysis (HD) patients; very limited data are available regarding patients on PD. This review summarizes the rationale for iron therapy, methods of treatment, potential adverse effects, and long-term concerns in PD patients.

The incidence of anaphylactic reactions during anesthesia is between 1:5000 and 1:25000 anesthetics. During the IgE-mediated anaphylactic reaction mast cells release proteases such as tryptase, histamine and vasoactive mediators. The release of mediators from the mast cells and basophils is responsible for the immediate clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis. Anaphylactoid reactions can be caused directly by a release of histamine and other mediators from mast cells and basophils and they don't depend on interaction of IgE antibodies with antigen. The most frequent agents that cause anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions during anesthesia are neuromuscular blocking agents (among them the highest percent refers to rocuronium and succinylcholine), some general anesthetics, antibiotics, blood and blood products, opioids and latex. Increased tryptase concentration in serum is a marker for systemic mast cell activation. Skin tests (in vivo) are used for verification of specific hypersensitivity to drugs in patients after anaphylactic reaction. In vitro tests prove the presence of specific IgE antibodies for drugs. The plan for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions must be established before the event. Airway maintenance, 100% oxygen administration, intravascular volume expansion and epinephrine are essential to treat the hypotension and hypoxia that result from vasodilatation, increased capillary permeability and bronchospasm. As soon as the diagnosis has been made the adrenalin should be given intravenously 1 to 3 ml of 1:10000 aqueous solution (0.1 mg/ml) over 10 minutes. Prevention is possible with methylprednisolone 125 mg i.v. 1 hour before administering of anesthetics and neuromuscular blocking agents with or without antihistaminic chlorpiramine-chloride 1 amp i.v. few minutes before anesthesia.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"During the IgE-mediated anaphylactic reaction mast cells release proteases such as tryptase, histamine and vasoactive mediators\"]}"}]}

As new gene-related treatment options for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are being developed, precise information about the patients' genetic diagnosis and knowledge about the diversities of natural history in DMD is vital. To obtain detailed insight into the genetic and clinical characteristics of paediatric DMD in Norway. 94 boys with DMD, aged 0-18 years, were identified over a period of 3.5 years, yielding a national prevalence of 13.5\u00d710-5 boys. 73 boys (78%) were recruited to full genetic and clinical or limited (genetic only) evaluation. Molecular analysis disclosed 64% deletions, 18% duplications and 18% point mutations. The mean age of diagnosis was 3.9\u00b12.0 years. 78% were treated with glucocorticoids from age 5.8\u00b11.5 years. 23 boys (35%) had lost ambulation at an age of 10.7\u00b12.0 years. 17% were treated for left ventricular dysfunction from age 12.1\u00b13.0 years and 12% had received night-time non-invasive positive pressure ventilation from age 13.0\u00b12.5 years. The distribution of mutation types and sites was similar to previous studies but with more duplications and fewer point mutations. Any genotype-phenotype correlations were not uncovered. The boys were diagnosed early but there is still diagnostic delay among boys presenting with late motor development. Glucocorticoid treatment was widespread, especially among the younger boys.

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits.

Monoclonal antibodies against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) are effective therapies in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Herein, the authors performed a systematic review investigating differences in the toxicities of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. An electronic literature search was performed of public databases (MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE [EMBASE], and Cochrane) and conference proceedings for trials using PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) in patients with NSCLC. A formal systematic analysis was conducted with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version 2.2). Clinical and demographic characteristics, response, and toxicity data were compared between both groups. A total of 23 studies reported between 2013 and 2016 were eligible for analysis. The total number of patients evaluated for toxicities was 3284 patients in the PD-1 group and 2460 patients in the PD-L1 group. The baseline patient characteristics of the 2 groups were similar, although there was a trend toward increased squamous histology in the group treated with PD-L1 (32% vs 25%; P = .6). There was no difference in response rate noted between PD-1 (19%) and PD-L1 (18.6%) inhibitors (P = .17). The incidence of overall adverse events (AEs) was comparable between the PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors (64% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 63%-66%] vs 66% [95% CI, 65%-69%]; P = .8). Fatigue was the most frequently reported AE with both classes of drugs. Patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors were found to have a slightly increased rate of immune-related AEs (16% [95% CI, 14%-17%] vs 11% [95% CI, 10%-13%]; P = .07) and pneumonitis (4% [95% CI, 3%-5%] vs 2% [95% CI, 1%-3%]; P = .01) compared with patients who received PD-L1 inhibitors.

Protein degradation is one of the tactics used by the cell for irreversibly inactivating proteins. In eukaryotes, ATP-dependent protein degradation in the cytoplasm and nucleus is carried out by the 26S proteasome. Most proteins are targeted to the 26S proteasome by covalent attachment of a multiubiquitin chain. A key component of the enzyme cascade that results in attachment of the multiubiquitin chain to the target or labile protein is the ubiquitin ligase that controls the specificity of the ubiquitination reaction. Defects in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis have been shown to result in a variety of human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic disorders. The SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box-Hrt1) complex is a heteromeric ubiquitin ligase that multiubiquitinates proteins important for signal transduction and cell cycle progression. A technology was developed known as Protac (Proteolysis Targeting Chimeric Molecule) that acts as a bridge, bringing together the SCF ubiquitin ligase with a protein target, resulting in its ubiquitination and degradation. The Protac contains an SCF-binding peptide moiety at one end that is recognized by SCF that is chemically linked to the binding partner or ligand of the target protein. The first demonstration of the efficacy of Protac technology was the successful recruitment, ubiquitination, and degradation of the protein methionine aminopeptidase-2 (MetAP-2) through a covalent interaction between MetAP-2 and Protac. Subsequently, we demonstrated that Protacs could effectively ubiquitinate and degrade cancer-promoting proteins (estrogen and androgen receptors) through noncovalent interactions in vitro and in cells. Finally, cell-permeable Protacs can also promote the degradation of proteins in cells. This chapter includes experiments to test the ability of Protacs to target proteins in vitro and in cells.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"A technology was developed known as Protac (Proteolysis Targeting Chimeric Molecule) that acts as a bridge, bringing together the SCF ubiquitin ligase with a protein target, resulting in its ubiquitination and degradation.\"]}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows.

In order to better educate patients, predictive models have been implemented to stratify surgical risk, thereby instituting greater uniformity across surgical practices and prioritizing the safety and outcomes of patients. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review summarizing the major predictive models used to evaluate patients as candidates for spinal surgery. A search was conducted for articles related to predictive modeling in spinal surgeries using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus databases. Papers with area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) scores reported were included in the analysis. Models not relevant to spinal procedures were excluded. Comparison between models was only attainable for those that reported AUROCs for individual procedures. Based on a combination of AUROC scores and demonstrated applicability to spinal procedures, the models by Scheer et al. (0.89), Ratliff et al. (0.70), the Seattle Spine Score (0.712), Risk Assessment Tool (0.67-0.7), and the Spine Sage calculator (0.81-0.85) were determined to be ideal for predictive modeling in spinal surgeries and were subsequently broken down into their individual inputs and outputs to determine what elements a theoretical model should assimilate. Alongside the model by Scheer et al., the Spine Sage calculator, Seattle Spine Score, Risk Assessment Tool, and a model by Ratliff et al. showed the most promise for patients undergoing spinal procedures. Using the first model as a springboard, new spinal predictive models can be optimized through use of larger prospective databases, with longer follow-up times, and greater inclusion of reliable high impact variables.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"sing PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus databases.

Renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS) is often used as an initial screening test for children after urinary tract infection (UTI), and the 2011 AAP guidelines specifically recommend RBUS be performed first, with voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) to be performed only if the ultrasound is abnormal. It is uncertain whether specific RBUS findings, alone or in combination, might make RBUS more useful as a predictor of VCUG abnormalities. To evaluate the association of specific RBUS with VCUG findings, and determine whether predictive models that accurately predict patients at high risk of VCUG abnormalities, based on RBUS findings, can be constructed. and study sample: A total of 3995 patients were identified with VCUG and RBUS performed on the same day. The RBUS and VCUG reports were reviewed and the findings were classified. Analysis was limited to patients aged 0-60 months with no prior postnatal genitourinary imaging and no history of prenatal hydronephrosis. The associations between large numbers of specific RBUS findings with abnormalities seen on VCUG were investigated. Both multivariate logistic models and a neural network machine learning algorithms were constructed to evaluate the predictive power of RBUS for VCUG abnormalities (including VUR or bladder/urethral findings). Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and area under receiving operating curves (AUROC) of RBUS for VCUG abnormalities were determined. A total of 2259 patients with UTI as the indication for imaging were identified. The RBUS was reported as \"normal\" in 75.0%. On VCUG, any VUR was identified in 41.7%, VUR grade > II in 20.9%, and VUR grade > III in 2.8%. Many individual RBUS findings were significantly associated with VUR on VCUG. Despite these strong univariate associations, multivariate modeling didn't result in a predictive model that was highly accurate. Multivariate logistic regression built via stepwise selection had: AUROC = 0.57, sensitivity = 86% and specificity = 25% for any VUR; AUROC = 0.60, sensitivity = 5% and specificity = 99% for VUR grade > II; and AUROC = 0.67, sensitivity = 6% and specificity = 99% for VUR grade > III.

The programmed death-1 (PD-1) molecule is involved in peripheral tolerance and in the immune escape mechanisms during chronic viral infections and cancer. PD-1 interacts with two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. We have investigated the molecular mechanisms of PD-1 interactions with its ligands by surface plasmon resonance and cell surface binding as well as the ability of the two ligands to compete for PD-1 binding. PD-L1 and PD-L2 bound PD-1 with comparable affinities, but striking differences were observed at the level of the association and dissociation characteristics. PD-L1, but not PD-L2, had a delayed interaction reminiscent of a phenomenon of conformational transition. These mechanisms were confirmed by using PD-L1 mAbs that delayed the dissociation of PD-L1 from PD-1. This mechanism was not restricted to PD-1 binding since PD-L1 behaved in a similar manner with its second ligand, CD80. Finally, we could demonstrate that PD-L1 and PD-L2 competed for PD-1 binding and conversely, an antagonist PD-1 mAb blocked both PD-L1 and PD-L2 binding to PD-1 and strongly enhanced T-cell proliferation. These data further emphasize the differential molecular mechanisms of interaction of PD-L1 and PD-L2 with PD-1, and suggest possible new approach for the therapy of chronic infection, cancer and transplantation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"PD-1 interacts with two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.\", \"Finally, we could demonstrate that PD-L1 and PD-L2 competed for PD-1 binding and conversely, an antagonist PD-1 mAb blocked both PD-L1 and PD-L2 binding to PD-1 and strongly enhanced T-cell proliferation.\"]}"}]}

Dermatillomania or skin picking disorder (SPD) is a chronic, recurrent, and treatment resistant neuropsychiatric disorder with an underestimated prevalence that has a concerning negative impact on an individual's health and quality of life. The current treatment strategies focus on behavioral and pharmacological therapies that are not very effective. Thus, the primary objective of this review is to provide an introduction to SPD and discuss its current treatment strategies as well as to propose biomaterial-based physical barrier strategies as a supporting or alternative treatment. To this end, searches were conducted within the PubMed database and Google Scholar, and the results obtained were organized and presented as per the following categories: prevalence, etiology, consequences, diagnostic criteria, and treatment strategies. Furthermore, special attention was provided to alternative treatment strategies and biomaterial-based physical treatment strategies. A total of six products with the potential to be applied as physical barrier strategies in supporting SPD treatment were shortlisted and discussed. The results indicated that SPD is a complex, underestimated, and underemphasized neuropsychiatric disorder that needs heightened attention, especially with regard to its treatment and care. Moreover, the high synergistic potential of biomaterials and nanosystems in this area remains to be explored. Certain strategies that are already being utilized for wound healing can also be further exploited, particularly as far as the prevention of infections is concerned.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Dermatillomania or skin picking disorder (SPD) is a chronic, recurrent, and treatment resistant neuropsychiatric disorder with an underestimated prevalence that has a concerning negative impact on an individual's health and quality of life. \"]}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

Necroptosis, or regulated necrosis, is an important type of programmed cell death in addition to apoptosis. Necroptosis induction leads to cell membrane disruption, inflammation and vascularization. It plays important roles in various pathological processes, including neurodegeneration, inflammatory diseases, multiple cancers, and kidney injury. The molecular regulation of necroptotic pathway has been intensively studied in recent years. Necroptosis can be triggered by multiple stimuli and this pathway is regulated through activation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), RIPK3 and pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). A better understanding of the mechanism of regulation of necroptosis will further aid to the development of novel drugs for necroptosis-associated human diseases. In this review, we focus on new insights in the regulatory machinery of necroptosis. We further discuss the role of necroptosis in different pathologies, its potential as a therapeutic target and the current status of clinical development of drugs interfering in the necroptotic pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Necroptosis induction leads to cell membrane disruption, inflammation and vascularization.\"]}"}]}

Adult gliomas are most often infiltrative. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classed them into three major groups according to the presomptive cell of origin: astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma and mixed oligoastrocytoma. Depending on the presence or absence of a small number of signs of anaplasia (mitosis, nuclear atypia, cell density, microvascular proliferation and necrosis) the WHO distinguishes grade II (LGG), III (anaplastic), and IV (glioblastomas, GBM). Mutation in the isocitrate deshydrogenase I and II (IDH1 and 2) genes distinguishes grade II, III and secondary GBM from primary GBM. Moreover two additional genetic alterations are recorded in grade II and III gliomas: TP53 mutations that characterize astrocytomas and 1p19q codeletion (as the result of t(1;19)(q10;p10) translocation) recorded in oligodendrogliomas. Mixed gliomas, the most non-reproducible category, share with astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas the same genetic alterations. Interestingly TP53 mutation (p53+) and 1p19q codeletion (1p19q+) are mutually exclusive and involve IDH mutated (IDH+) glial precursor cells. According to IDH, TP53, and 1p19q status, four major subtypes of LGG are recorded: IDH+/p53-/1p19q-, IDH+/p53+/1p19q-, IDH+/p53-/1p19q+ and triple negative, this last subgroup having the worst prognosis. Interestingly, p53 expression and internexin alpha (INA) expression can replace to some extent TP53 mutation and 1p19 codeletion, respectively. Moreover the antibody directed against the IDH1R132H isoform is highly specific. Because this mutation is the most frequent it is sufficient to assess IDH status in more than 80% of grade II and III gliomas. Taken together these three immunohistochemical markers are contribute greatly to the classification of gliomas and should be tested routinely as diagnostic markers. Finally, although GBM are genetically heterogeneous, the vast majority display EGFR amplification, often associated with EGFR expression, which can be helpful for diagnosis in certain cases.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Adult gliomas are most often infiltrative.

Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua.

This study used supervised machine learning-based predictive modeling to identify predictors of long-term ABR during prophylaxis with an extended half-life FVIII. \u2003Data were from 166 SHA patients who received N8-GP prophylaxis (50\u2009IU/kg every 4 days) in the pathfinder 2 study. Predictive models were developed to identify variables associated with an ABR of \u22641 versus >1 during the trial's main phase (median follow-up of 469 days). Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). Pre-N8-GP prophylaxis models learned from data collected at baseline; post-N8-GP prophylaxis models learned from data collected up to 12-weeks postswitch to N8-GP, and predicted ABR at the end of the outcome period (final year of treatment in the main phase). \u2003The predictive model using baseline variables had moderate performance (AUROC\u2009=\u20090.64) for predicting observed ABR. The most performant model used data collected at 12-weeks postswitch (AUROC\u2009=\u20090.79) with cumulative bleed count up to 12 weeks as the most informative variable, followed by baseline von Willebrand factor and mean FVIII at 30\u2009minutes postdose. Univariate cumulative bleed count at 12 weeks performed equally well to the 12-weeks postswitch model (AUROC\u2009=\u20090.75). Pharmacokinetic measures were indicative, but not essential, to predict ABR. \u2003Cumulative bleed count up to 12-weeks postswitch was as informative as the 12-week post-switch predictive model for predicting long-term ABR, supporting alterations in prophylaxis based on treatment response.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"ys).

The thymus is critical for central tolerance and diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire development, to provide lifelong defense against pathogens while maintaining self-tolerance. Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) can be associated with autoantibodies, including those of IgM class with specificity for the trisulfated heparan disaccharide (TS-HDS) antigen. We hypothesized that, as an IgM autoantibody-mediated disorder, TS-HDS-associated SFN symptoms may be reduced with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). This was an observational analysis of all patients referred for TPE from 2018 to 2020 following laboratory confirmation of SFN with TS-HDS autoantibodies; a loading course of 3 to 5 procedures over 2\u2009weeks was completed, with some patients returning for monthly procedures. The following data were collected: demographics, symptoms and duration, TS-HDS levels, skin biopsy results, reported responses to TPE, and TPE-associated adverse events. Of the 17 subjects, 12 (71%) were female and the mean age was 57.5\u2009years (range 27-94). The most common reported symptom was lower extremity paresthesia (88% of subjects). The mean number of TPE procedures completed per subject was 9 (range 3-18), with 71% (12/17) reporting symptomatic improvement or slowed disease progression. About 15% of procedures were associated with an adverse event, with vasovagal reactions being the most common; 53% of patients had at least one adverse event. Given a reported symptomatic response rate of more than 70%, TPE may be a treatment option for individuals with autoimmune-mediated SFN associated with increased titers of TS-HDS IgM autoantibodies. Since TPE-associated adverse events appear common in this population, close monitoring during procedures is warranted.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"mall fiber neuropathy (SFN) can be associated with autoantibodies, including those of IgM class with specificity for the trisulfated heparan disaccharide (TS-HDS) antigen.\"]}"}]}

Anemia in chronic renal failure is predominantly caused by diminished erythropoietin synthesis by diseased kidneys. While iron deficiency is often stated as a cause of anemia in chronic renal failure prior to end-stage renal disease, its relative contribution is debated. It is speculated that rather than frank 'iron deficiency', many patients with chronic renal failure may indeed have impaired utilization of iron. We analyzed 139 consecutive patients with chronic renal failure starting maintenance hemodialysis to determine the relationship between hematocrit, measures of renal function (blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine concentration), and measures of iron availability (serum transferrin saturation, serum iron level and serum ferritin). The 139 study subjects (60 men, 79 women) comprised 116 blacks (83%), 15 hispanics (11%), and 8 whites (6%) of a mean age 56 +/- 15 years. Only 23 (17%) of 139 subjects had positive hemoccult stool test for blood. Their mean hematocrit was 24 +/- 4.5%, mean blood urea nitrogen concentration was 121 +/- 38, mean serum creatinine concentration was 12.6 +/- 5.2 mg/dl, mean serum transferrin saturation was 22 +/- 14%, mean serum ferritin level was 235 +/- 194 U/l, mean serum iron level was 55 +/- 40 U/l, and mean total iron binding capacity was 254 +/- 93%. Multiple regression analysis with hematocrit as the outcome variable, and blood urea nitrogen level, serum creatinine concentration, serum albumin concentration, serum transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin level as the independent variables, showed an inverse correlation between hematocrit and serum creatinine concentration (p = 0.002). We conclude that in patients with chronic renal failure starting uremia therapy, anemia does not correlate with any of the commonly measured indices of body iron stores. We infer that impaired utilization of iron may be a significant factor in the anemia of chronic renal failure.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"While iron deficiency is often stated as a cause of anemia in chronic renal failure prior to end-stage renal disease, its relative contribution is debated.\", \"Anemia in chronic renal failure is predominantly caused by diminished erythropoietin synthesis by diseased kidneys.\", \"We infer that impaired utilization of iron may be a significant factor in the anemia of chronic renal failure.\"]}"}]}

Yet it seems that there is no universal consensus neither on its definition nor in relation to the specific lesions that might cause it. There seems to be no consensus either around the criteria that might enable us to identify different types of prosopagnosia. We make an attempt to revise the definition of prosopagnosia and to see if it is appropriate to consider it as a single entity or, on the contrary, we are able to differentiate specific types of prosopagnosia according to its origin, brain lesion associated with it or the patients characteristics. On the other hand, we questioned ourselves whether different exams usually utilized for the identification of prosopagnosia in fact measure the same concept. We propose that we could distinguish different types of prosopagnosia with different clinical characteristics. Then we went on to differentiate between developed prosopagnosias and acquired prosopagnosias by bilateral brain lesion as opposed with those associated with a fundamentally aperceptive deficit, as opposed to those linked with a fundamentally associative deficit. Lastly, we propose that different types of exams of recognition and identification can measure distinct aspects linked to prosopagnosia.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"INTRODUCTION: The prosopagnosia has generally been defined as an incapacity to recognize familiar faces, or faces previously known, due to certain lesions to certain areas of the ce\"]}"}]}

Checkpoint inhibitors are revolutionizing treatment options and expectations for patients with melanoma. Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), was the first approved checkpoint inhibitor. Emerging long-term data indicate that approximately 20% of ipilimumab-treated patients achieve long-term survival. The first programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, pembrolizumab, was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of melanoma; nivolumab was previously approved in Japan. PD-1 inhibitors are also poised to become standard of care treatment for other cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibition is a different treatment approach to chemotherapy and targeted agents: instead of directly acting on the tumor to induce tumor cell death, checkpoint inhibitors enhance or de novo stimulate antitumor immune responses to eliminate cancer cells. Initial data suggest that objective anti-tumor response rates may be higher with anti-PD-1 agents compared with ipilimumab and the safety profile may be more tolerable. This review explores the development and next steps for PD-1 pathway inhibitors, including discussion of their novel mechanism of action and clinical data to-date, with a focus on melanoma. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The first programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, pembrolizumab, was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of melanoma; nivolumab was previously approved in Japan. \", \"The first programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, pembrolizumab, was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of melanoma; nivolumab was previously approved in Japan.\"]}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Corticosteroids improve strength and function in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, there is uncertainty regarding the optimum regimen and dosage. To compare efficacy and adverse effects of the 3 most frequently prescribed corticosteroid regimens in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Double-blind, parallel-group randomized clinical trial including 196 boys aged 4 to 7 years with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who had not previously been treated with corticosteroids; enrollment occurred between January 30, 2013, and September 17, 2016, at 32 clinic sites in 5 countries. The boys were assessed for 3 years (last participant visit on October 16, 2019). Participants were randomized to daily prednisone (0.75 mg/kg) (n\u2009=\u200965), daily deflazacort (0.90 mg/kg) (n\u2009=\u200965), or intermittent prednisone (0.75 mg/kg for 10 days on and then 10 days off) (n\u2009=\u200966). The global primary outcome comprised 3 end points: rise from the floor velocity (in rise/seconds), forced vital capacity (in liters), and participant or parent global satisfaction with treatment measured by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM; score range, 0 to 100), each averaged across all study visits after baseline. Pairwise group comparisons used a Bonferroni-adjusted significance level of .017. Among the 196 boys randomized (mean age, 5.8 years [SD, 1.0 years]), 164 (84%) completed the trial. Both daily prednisone and daily deflazacort were more effective than intermittent prednisone for the primary outcome (P\u2009<\u2009.001 for daily prednisone vs intermittent prednisone using a global test; P\u2009=\u2009.017 for daily deflazacort vs intermittent prednisone using a global test) and the daily regimens did not differ significantly (P\u2009=\u2009.38 for daily prednisone vs daily deflazacort using a global test). The between-group differences were principally attributable to rise from the floor velocity (0.06 rise/s [98.3% CI, 0.03 to 0.08 rise/s] for daily prednisone vs intermittent prednisone [P\u2009=\u2009.003]; 0.06 rise/s [98.3% CI, 0.03 to 0.09 rise/s] for daily deflazacort vs intermittent prednisone [P\u2009=\u2009.017]; and -0.004 rise/s [98.3% CI, -0.03 to 0.02 rise/s] for daily prednisone vs daily deflazacort [P\u2009=\u2009.75]). The pairwise comparisons for forced vital capacity and TSQM global satisfaction subscale score were not statistically significant. The most common adverse events were abnormal behavior (22 [34%] in the daily prednisone group, 25 [38%] in the daily deflazacort group, and 24 [36%] in the intermittent prednisone group), upper respiratory tract infection (24 [37%], 19 [29%], and 24 [36%], respectively), and vomiting (19 [29%], 17 [26%], and 15 [23%]).

A total of 334 adults were assessed for eligibility, and 132 underwent randomization (64 were assigned to receive 450-mg litifilimab, 6 to receive 150-mg litifilimab, 6 to receive 50-mg litifilimab, and 56 to receive placebo). The primary analysis was conducted in the 102 participants who had received 450-mg litifilimab or placebo and had at least four tender and at least four swollen joints. The mean (\u00b1SD) baseline number of active joints was 19.0\u00b18.4 in the litifilimab group and 21.6\u00b18.5 in the placebo group. The least-squares mean (\u00b1SE) change from baseline to week 24 in the total number of active joints was -15.0\u00b11.2 with litifilimab and -11.6\u00b11.3 with placebo (mean difference, -3.4; 95% confidence interval, -6.7 to -0.2; P\u2009=\u20090.04). Most of the secondary end points did not support the results of the analysis of the primary end point. Receipt of litifilimab was associated with adverse events, including two cases of herpes zoster and one case of herpes keratitis. In a phase 2 trial involving participants with SLE, litifilimab was associated with a greater reduction from baseline in the number of swollen and tender joints than placebo over a period of 24 weeks. Longer and larger trials are required to determine the safety and efficacy of litifilimab for the treatment of SLE.

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

While the vast majority of these circRNAs comprise canonical exonic and intronic sequences, microexons (MEs)-which occur in 30% of functional mRNA transcripts-have been entirely overlooked. CircRNAs which contain these known MEs (ME-circRNAs) could be identified with commonly utilized circRNA prediction pipelines, CIRCexplorer2 and CIRI2, but were not previously recognized as ME-circRNAs.

The c statistic, however, may not be optimal in assessing models that predict future risk or stratify individuals into risk categories. In this setting, calibration is as important to the accurate assessment of risk. For example, a biomarker with an odds ratio of 3 may have little effect on the c statistic, yet an increased level could shift estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk for an individual patient from 8% to 24%, which would lead to different treatment recommendations under current Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Accepted risk factors such as lipids, hypertension, and smoking have only marginal impact on the c statistic individually yet lead to more accurate reclassification of large proportions of patients into higher-risk or lower-risk categories. Perfectly calibrated models for complex disease can, in fact, only achieve values for the c statistic well below the theoretical maximum of 1. Use of the c statistic for model selection could thus naively eliminate established risk factors from cardiovascular risk prediction scores. As novel risk factors are discovered, sole reliance on the c statistic to evaluate their utility as risk predictors thus seems ill-advised.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The c statistic, or area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, achieved popularity in diagnostic testing, in which the test characteristics of sensitivity and specificity are relevant to discriminating diseased versus nondiseased patients.\"]}"}]}

Mantle cell lymphoma is a mature, virgin B-cell neoplasm characterized immunologically by a panB+, CD5+, CD23-, cyclin D1+ phenotype and genetically by t(11;14)(q13;q32) with overexpression of the cyclin D1 (bcl-1) gene. It usually presents as advanced stage disease, involving lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, and extranodal sites, particularly the gastrointestinal tract. However, frank leukemic presentation with high white cell counts is uncommon and can be difficult to distinguish from other chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. The aim of this study was to characterize the morphologic spectrum of leukemic mantle cell lymphoma. During the period July 1994 through October 1998, 14 patients with mantle cell lymphoma in leukemic phase were diagnosed at the Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong. The diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma was based on histologic and immunocytochemical findings and was confirmed by cyclin D1 immunoreactivity in all cases. The clinical records and laboratory results were reviewed. Peripheral blood smears, bone marrow, and other tissue biopsies were examined, with particular attention to the cytologic features of the leukemic mantle cells. Mantle cell lymphoma in leukemic phase showed a very aggressive clinical course. Eight patients died at a mean of 13 months, and only 1 patient was disease free. Morphologically, the leukemic mantle cells exhibited a broad morphologic spectrum, with several cytologic patterns identified: 1) mixed small and medium-sized cells, 2) predominantly medium-sized cells, 3) predominantly large cells, and 4) giant cells. Despite variations in the size and nuclear shape, the leukemic mantle cells could usually be recognized by the nuclear irregularity and clefting, moderately dense but evenly distributed chromatin, small nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm. Recognition of the characteristic cytologic features of leukemic mantle cells can help to distinguish them from other chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. In contrast to the latter, the clinical course is aggressive and response to conventional chemotherapy is poor.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"BACKGROUND: Mantle cell lymphoma is a mature, virgin B-cell neoplasm characterized immunologically by a panB+, CD5+, CD23-, cyclin D1+ phenotype and g\", \"BACKGROUND: Mantle cell lymphoma is a mature, virgin B-cell neoplasm characterized immunologically by a panB+, CD5+, CD23-, cyclin D1+ phenotype and genetically by t(11;14)(q13;q32) with overexpression of the cyclin D1 (bcl-1) gene\"]}"}]}

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Configurations using planar optical waveguides to produce such fields are shown here to present also a dramatic excitation irradiance enhancement at the guide/surrounding matter interface. We compare theoretically and experimentally a guided excitation with a classical external excitation. A full electromagnetic analysis predicts an irradiance increase higher than 10(4) for adequately tailored waveguides. We deposited high-index TiO(2) sol-gel waveguides on glass substrates according to best simulations. Quantitative enhancement analysis exploiting actual biological fluorescent spots perfectly confirms the irradiance amplification effect of a thin waveguide. The impact of amplification on the design of biochip readers is discussed since it leaves ample margin for simple and low-cost light couplers, advantageous in affordable readers and sensor systems.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are designed to restore a patient's own antitumor immune response that has been suppressed during tumor development. The first monoclonal antibodies against the immune checkpoint programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, are now approved for clinical use. Both agents are indicated for the treatment of advanced melanoma, as well as for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nivolumab is also approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. In patients with melanoma, these agents result in objective response rates of ~25-40%, with durable responses lasting more than 2\u00a0years in some cases. Results from phase III trials have shown improved survival with nivolumab versus standard-of-care chemotherapy in both patients with advanced melanoma and those with advanced NSCLC. In patients with advanced melanoma, both PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) have shown improved survival versus ipilimumab. PD-1 inhibitors are associated with adverse events that have immune etiologies, with grade greater than 3 adverse events typically reported in 16% or less of patients. However, most immune-mediated adverse events (including grade 3-4 adverse events) can be managed by using published management algorithms without permanent discontinuation of the agent. As nivolumab and pembrolizumab enter the clinic, and with more PD-1 pathway agents in development for a range of tumor types, this review aims to provide pharmacists with a basic understanding of the role of PD-1 in modulating the immune system and their use in the cancer treatment. The most recent clinical efficacy and safety data are discussed, highlighting the response characteristics distinctive to immune checkpoint inhibitors, along with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data and cost considerations. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The first monoclonal antibodies against the immune checkpoint programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, are now approved for clinical use\"]}"}]}

The management of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) has undergone a paradigm shift with the development of androgen receptor axis-targeted (ARAT) agents. The updated results with final overall survival (OS) data of the phase III PROSPER, SPARTAN, and ARAMIS trials have recently been reported. Therefore, we performed an updated meta-analysis and network meta-analysis to indirectly compare the efficacy and safety of currently available treatments. Multiple databases were searched for articles published before January 2021. Studies that compared OS and adverse events (AEs) in patients with nmCRPC were considered eligible. Three studies (N.=4117) met our eligibility criteria. Formal network meta-analyses were conducted. ARAT agent is associated with significantly longer OS compared to placebo (pooled hazard ratio [HR]: 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65-0.83, P<0.001), with similar results shown for patients with both N1 and N0 disease (pooled HR 0.61 and pooled HR 0.76, respectively). In the network meta-analysis, apalutamide, darolutamide, and enzalutamide were more effective than placebo, with similar efficacies in terms of OS. For AEs (including any AEs, grade 3 or grade 4 AEs, grade 5 AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation), darolutamide was shown to be likely well tolerated. Quality of Life was preserved in treatment arms irrespective of the drug. All three ARAT agents are efficacious options for the treatment of nmCRPC, whereas darolutamide appears to have the most favorable tolerability profile. These findings may facilitate individualized treatment strategies and inform future direct comparative trials.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"CONCLUSIONS: All three ARAT agents are efficacious options for the treatment of nmCRPC, whereas darolutamide appears to have the most favorable tolerability profile. \"]}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Area under a receiver-operating-characteristic (AUROC) curve is widely used in medicine to summarize the ability of a continuous predictive marker to predict a binary outcome. This study illustrated how a U-shaped or inverted U-shaped continuous predictor would affect the shape and magnitude of its AUROC curve in predicting a binary outcome by comparing the ROC curves of the worst first 24-hour arterial pH values of 9549 consecutive critically ill patients in predicting hospital mortality before and after centering the predictor by its mean or median. A simulation dataset with an inverted U-shaped predictor was used to assess how this would affect the shape and magnitude of the AUROC curve. An asymmetrical U-shaped relationship between pH and hospital mortality, resulting in an inverse-sigmoidal ROC curve, was observed. The AUROC substantially increased after centering the predictor by its mean (0.611 vs 0.722, difference\u2009=\u20090.111, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.087-0.135), and was further improved after centering by its median (0.611 vs 0.745, difference\u2009=\u20090.133, 95%CI 0.110-0.157). A sigmoidal-shaped ROC curve was observed for an inverted U-shaped predictor. In summary, a non-linear predictor can result in a biphasic-shaped ROC curve; and centering the predictor can reduce its bias towards null predictive ability.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Area under a receiver-operating-characteristic (AUROC) curve is widely used in medicine to summarize the ability of a continuous predictive marker to predict a binary outcome.\"]}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant.

This data suggests the involvement of Cdk9 in several physiological processes in the cell, the deregulation of which may be related to the genesis of transforming events, that may in turn lead to the onset of cancer.

The natural history of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is variable and prediction of individual prognosis challenging. The inability to reliably predict prognosis at diagnosis has important implications for informed decision making especially in relation to disease modifying therapies. We conducted a systematic review in order to collate, describe and assess the methodological quality of published prediction models in RRMS. We searched Medline, Embase and Web of Science. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full text for eligibility and assessed risk of bias. Studies reporting development or validation of prediction models for RRMS in adults were included. Data collection was guided by the checklist for critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews (CHARMS) and applicability and methodological quality assessment by the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST). 30 studies were included in the review. Applicability was assessed as high risk of concern in 27 studies. Risk of bias was assessed as high for all studies. The single most frequently included predictor was baseline EDSS (n = 11). T2 Lesion volume or number and brain atrophy were each retained in seven studies. Five studies included external validation and none included impact analysis.

The choice of which agent to use is most often dictated by goals of therapy, tolerability, convenience, and response to prior therapy. Diminished absorption of iron in the gastrointestinal tract and a high incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects can reduce the efficacy of oral iron agents, necessitating the use of i.v. iron formulations to treat iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients requiring kidney replacement therapy. Newer oral agents may help to overcome these limitations and help treat iron deficiency in those not requiring kidney replacement therapy.

The microarray chip reader (MCR 3) is designed as a stand-alone platform, with the goal to quantify multiple analytes in complex matrices of food and liquid samples for field analysis or for routine analytical laboratories. The CL microarray platform is a self-contained system for the fully automated multiplexed immunoanalysis: the microarray chip, the fluidic system and the software module enable automated calibration and determination of analyte concentrations during a whole working day. The detection of antibiotics in milk was demonstrated to validate this device. There are few quantitative multi-residue detection methods for routine analysis although the EU has defined maximum residue limits (MRLs) for a number of antibacterial reagents. Therefore, an automated multianalyte detection instrument is needed quantifying simultaneously antibiotics within some minutes. Also regeneration is required to avoid replacing the assay surface. The MCR 3 uses a microarray chip, which consists of two channels for parallel measurement and regeneration. The microarray chip is designed for parallel analysis of up to 13 different antibiotics in milk applying an indirect competitive microarray immunoassay (MIA). Microspotted antibiotics are directly coupled to epoxylated PEG surfaces. As an initial example, penicillin G is quantified in milk on the MCR 3.

Anemia is the most common hematologic complication in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It is ascribed to decreased erythropoietin production, shortened red blood cell (RBC) lifespan, and inflammation. Uremic toxins severely affect RBC lifespan; however, the implicated molecular pathways are poorly understood. Moreover, current management of anemia in ESRD is controversial due to the \"anemia paradox\" phenomenon, which underlines the need for a more individualized approach to therapy. RBCs imprint the adverse effects of uremic, inflammatory, and oxidative stresses in a context of structural and functional deterioration that is associated with RBC removal signaling and morbidity risk. RBCs circulate in hostile plasma by raising elegant homeostatic defenses. Variability in primary defect, co-morbidity, and therapeutic approaches add complexity to the pathophysiological background of the anemic ESRD patient. Several blood components have been suggested as biomarkers of anemia-related morbidity and mortality risk in ESRD. However, a holistic view of blood cell and plasma modifications through integrated omics approaches and high-throughput studies might assist the development of new diagnostic tests and therapies that will target the underlying pathophysiologic processes of ESRD anemia.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Anemia is the most common hematologic complication in end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Wilkie's Syndrome, also known as Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome (SMAS), is a rare cause of bowel obstruction that can contribute to vague abdominal symptoms on clinical presentation. This syndrome occurs when the aortomesenteric angle decreases, compressing the third portion of the duodenum between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. An acute decrease in the mesenteric fat pad cushion between these two blood vessels is the primary etiology, although other causes (e.g., anatomical, postoperative, functional, and pubescent etiologies) have also been described. In the present cases, 2 females with a common history of recent weight loss presented to our institution with similar symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Each patient was subsequently diagnosed with SMAS following imaging studies. Both patients experienced successful resolution of symptoms with conservative nutritional management. Common presenting complaints of SMAS include nausea, vomiting, early satiety and postprandial pain. These symptoms overlap with other gastrointestinal disorders (i.e., mesenteric ischemia, intestinal volvulus, peptic ulcer disease) making diagnosis difficult. SMAS can be identified through imaging modalities including barium studies and computer tomography. First line therapies typically include conservative nutritional support and promotion of weight gain. If conservative therapies fail, various surgical procedures can be pursued. Delayed diagnosis can lead to further pathological sequelae, including duodenal compromise, ischemia and necrosis. As the syndrome progresses, success of conservative nutritional support is less likely, and surgical correction becomes increasingly necessary. Therefore, a clinical goal for SMAS should include as swift a recognition and diagnosis as possible.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"INTRODUCTION: Wilkie's Syndrome, also known as Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome (SMAS), is a rare cause of bowel obstruction that can contribute to vague abdominal symptoms on clinical presentation.\"]}"}]}

Clinical interest in the measurement of Cereblon (CRBN), the primary target of the IMiDs immunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide, has been fueled by its essential requirement for antitumor or immunomodulatory activity of both drugs in multiple myeloma (MM). However, limited analyses of clinical samples for CRBN gene expression or protein levels have utilized unvalidated reagents and assays, raising uncertainty about the interpretation of these results. We previously described a highly specific rabbit monoclonal antibody CRBN65 against 65-76 AA of human Cereblon. Here we describe a validated dual color bright-field Cereblon/CD138 immunohistochemical (IHC) assay utilizing CRBN65 and a commercial mouse monoclonal CD138 antibody. Sensitivity and specificity of the assay was determined and assay precision was shown for both cytoplasmic and nuclear Cereblon in MM bone marrow samples with coefficient of variation values of 5% and 2%, respectively. The dual IHC assay was effective for detecting a continuous range of Cereblon levels in 22 MM patient bone marrow core biopsies and aspirate clots, as shown by average cytoplasmic H-scores ranging from 63 to 267 and nuclear H-scores ranging from 17 to 250. Interpathologist comparison of MM sample H-scores by 3 pathologists demonstrated good concordance (R=0.73). This dual assay demonstrated superior Cereblon IHC measurement in MM samples compared with the single IHC assay using a published commercial rabbit polyclonal Cereblon antibody and could be used to explore the potential utility of Cereblon as a biomarker in the clinic.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Clinical interest in the measurement of Cereblon (CRBN), the primary target of the IMiDs immunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide, has been fueled by its essential requirement for antitumor or immunomodulatory activity of both drugs in multiple myeloma (MM).\"]}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

We evaluated the quantity and quality of scientific publications linked with water treatments using the Web of Science (WoS) database. The WoS was searching by using the following terms \"hydrotherapy,\" \"balneotherapy,\" \"spa therapy,\" \"spa treatment,\" \"creno-balneotherapy,\" \"water treatments,\" and \"aqua therapy,\" on February 10th, 2022. The recorded data were the total number of articles, year of articles, country of articles, journal, document type, index data, and citation data. Also, the studies performed with natural source mineral water were marked to make a further subgroup analysis through quality and quantity. We obtained 816 articles; 667 (81.74%) were original research articles, and 149 (18.26%) were review articles. A statistically significant and increasing trend was shown in the publication about water treatments (p\u2009<\u20090.01). About three-quarters of the trials were sourced from high-income countries. Italy (n\u2009=\u200998; 12.01%); Turkey (n\u2009=\u200975; 9.19%); Australia (n\u2009=\u200965; 7.97%); Brazil (n\u2009=\u200946; 5.64%); and France (n\u2009=\u200938; 4.66%) were the most productive countries. Calculating the number of articles per million population, Hungary (3.38), Australia (2.53), and Italy (1.64) ranked in the top three. According to 100 billion dollars GDP, the top three countries were Brazil (24.41), Hungary (21.15), and Turkey (10.41). In the average citation calculation, the Netherlands (60.84), Israel (29.86), and Australia (29.06) were in the top three. The International Journal of Biometeorology was the leading journal for publication trials about water treatments. In the subgroup analysis, we found the total number of studies performed with natural source mineral water and non-specified source water trials as 430 and 386, respectively. We also presented that the natural source and non-specified water trials had a statistically significant and increasing trend between 2000 and 2021 (p\u2009<\u20090.01 and p\u2009<\u20090.01, respectively).

The top journal of the natural source water trials was the International Journal of Biometeorology (n\u2009=\u200965; 15.12%), and for the non-specified water trials, it was the International Journal of Sports Physiology (n\u2009=\u200912; 3.11%).Our study presented an increasing trend in trial publications regarding water treatments between 2000 and 2021. Most of the trials were from high and upper-middle-income countries. We suggest that by demonstrating global productivity worldwide, our results can create more scientific attention on this topic and may promote the quantity and quality of the trials.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"hydrotherapy,\\\" \\\"balneotherapy,\\\" \\\"spa therapy,\\\" \\\"spa treatment,\\\" \\\"creno-balneotherapy,\\\" \\\"water treatments,\\\" and \\\"aqua therapy,\\\" o\"]}"}]}

This study was designed to compare biomechanical characteristics of the knee joint for several athletic tasks to elucidate their effects and to examine what tasks pose a risk for ACL injury. Three athletic tasks were performed by 24 female athletes: single-limb landing, plant and cutting, and both-limb jump landing. Angular displacements of flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and external/internal tibial rotation were calculated. Angular excursion and the rate of excursion of abduction and internal tibial rotation were also calculated. During plant and cutting, from foot contact, subjects rotated the tibia more rapidly and to a greater degree toward internal tibial rotation. Moreover, excursion of knee abduction is greater than that during single-limb landing. During both-limb jump landing, the knee flexion at foot contact was greater than for either single-limb landing or plant and cutting; peak knee abduction was greater than for either single-limb landing or plant and cutting. In plant and cutting, the risk of ACL injury is increased by greater excursion and more rapid knee abduction than that which occurs in single-limb landing, in addition to greater internal tibial rotation. Although single-limb tasks apparently pose a greater risk for ACL injury than bilateral landings, both-limb landing with greater knee abduction might also risk ACL injury.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA2) is a receptor that is exclusively expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of lupus erythematosus. Whether treatment with litifilimab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against BDCA2, would be efficacious in reducing disease activity in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus has not been extensively studied. In this phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned adults with histologically confirmed cutaneous lupus erythematosus with or without systemic manifestations in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous litifilimab (at a dose of 50, 150, or 450 mg) or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12. We used a dose-response model to assess whether there was a response across the four groups on the basis of the primary end point, which was the percent change from baseline to 16 weeks in the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index-Activity score (CLASI-A; scores range from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating more widespread or severe skin involvement). Safety was also assessed. A total of 132 participants were enrolled; 26 were assigned to the 50-mg litifilimab group, 25 to the 150-mg litifilimab group, 48 to the 450-mg litifilimab group, and 33 to the placebo group. Mean CLASI-A scores for the groups at baseline were 15.2, 18.4, 16.5, and 16.5, respectively. The difference from placebo in the change from baseline in CLASI-A score at week 16 was -24.3 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] -43.7 to -4.9) in the 50-mg litifilimab group, -33.4 percentage points (95% CI, -52.7 to -14.1) in the 150-mg group, and -28.0 percentage points (95% CI, -44.6 to -11.4) in the 450-mg group. The least squares mean changes were used in the primary analysis of a best-fitting dose-response model across the three drug-dose levels and placebo, which showed a significant effect. Most of the secondary end points did not support the results of the primary analysis. Litifilimab was associated with three cases each of hypersensitivity and oral herpes infection and one case of herpes zoster infection. One case of herpes zoster meningitis occurred 4 months after the participant received the last dose of litifilimab. In a phase 2 trial involving participants with cutaneous lupus erythematosus, treatment with litifilimab was superior to placebo with regard to a measure of skin disease activity over a period of 16 weeks. Larger and longer trials are needed to determine the effect and safety of litifilimab for the treatment of cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

The aggregation of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) on the surface of mast cells initiates a complex cascade of signaling events that ultimately leads to the release of various mediators involved in allergic inflammation and anaphylactic reactions. The release of these mediators is tightly controlled by signaling pathways that are propagated through the cell by specific phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events.

Cytochrome P450 1A1 is a major enzyme in the bioactivation of exogenous procarcinogens of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the contribution of common genetic variants in CYP1A1 to the HCC risk in Chinese populations has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we examined the association between HCC and four selected tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP1A1, and the risk of CYP1A1 haplotypes/diplotypes in 1006 pathologically confirmed HCC patients and 1015 cancer-free controls, from a Han Chinese population. Haplotypes/diplotypes were constructed from observed genotypes using the Haplo.Stats program. Relative risk was estimated by using multivariable logistic regression method. To summarise, we detected an increased HCC risk in rs4646421 variant carriers (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.61) and rs2198843 variant carriers (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.69), and a reduced risk of HCC (OR 0.70. 95% CI 0.52-0.94) associated with homozygote carriers of rs4886605 variant. These association signals were also observed in non-smokers with rs4646421 (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.16-2.08) and rs4886605 (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.91). Compared to the most common CYP1A1 haplotype CCAG, the haplotype TTGC conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.52). Similarly, the TTGC/TTGC diplotype conferred an increased risk of HCC compared with diplotype CCAG/CCAG (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.23-3.45, P=0.006). Interestingly, the diplotype TTAC/CCAG also conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.22-2.54, P=0.003). Our results suggested that common genetic variants in CYP1A1 may modulate the risk of developing HCC in the study population, particularly in non-smokers. However, our findings need to be validated in at least one independent study of Han Chinese population.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Diffuse gliomas in the adult population are the most common primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. The World Health Organization incorporated isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations and 1p/19q co-deletion with histopathological features into an \"integrated diagnosis\" in the revised classification of tumors of CNS. These molecular subgroups of diffuse gliomas are found to stratify patients into prognostically distinct groups better than the histological classification. The objectives of the current study were to assess the frequency of IDH mutation, ATRX expression loss, p53 overexpression, and 1p/19q co-deletion detection in adult diffuse gliomas (Grade II, III, and IV) and to correlate them with clinicopathological and histopathological features. The current study was a tertiary care hospital-based retrospective case series of 112 cases of adult diffuse gliomas. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based molecular detection was performed for IDH-1, ATRX, and p53 and fluorescent  IDH-1 mutation was present in 30.4% ( The results of the present study indicate that IHC including IDH1/2, ATRX, and p53 is useful for the molecular classification of diffuse gliomas, which could be useful for the evaluation of prognosis, especially Grade III and II. Although the immunohistochemical approach does not replace genetic testing completely, it is a practical and powerful means of assessing molecular genetic changes. IDH mutations are the established markers of better prognosis in diffuse gliomas.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"ssion, and 1p/19q co-deletion detection in adult diffuse gliomas (Grade II, III, and IV) and to correlate them with clinicopathological and histopatho\"]}"}]}

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the common malignancy and lacks effective therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of trophinin-associated protein (TROAP) dramatically drove HCC cell growth assessed by foci formation in monolayer culture, colony formation in soft agar and orthotopic liver transplantation in nude mice. Inversely, silencing TROAP expression with short-hairpin RNA attenuated the malignant proliferation of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Next, mechanistic investigation revealed that TROAP directly bound to dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A/B (DYRK1A/B), resulting in the cytoplasmic retention of proteins DYRK1A/B and promoting cell cycle process via activation of Akt/GSK-3\u03b2 signaling. Combination of cisplatin with an inhibitor of DYRK1 AZ191 effectively inhibited tumor growth in mouse model for HCC cells with high level of TROAP. Clinically, TROAP was significantly upregulated by miR-142-5p in HCC tissues, which predicted the poor survival of patients with HCC. Therefore, TROAP/DYRK1/Akt axis may be a promising therapeutic target and prognostic indicator for patients with HCC.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"ctopic expression of trophinin-associated protein (TROAP) dramatically drove HCC cell growth assessed by foci formation in monolayer culture, colony f\"]}"}]}

Mastocytosis in adults is associated with a history of anaphylaxis in 22-49%. In addition, monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome has been described presenting with anaphylaxis, especially in patients with hymenoptera venom anaphylaxis. Data on patients with drug hypersensitivity and mast cell diseases are scarce. Drugs are elicitors of anaphylaxis in patients with mastocytosis. Drug hypersensitivity is only seldom described as associated with undetected mast cell disease in the literature. Together with a single-centred retrospective study, this data suggests that from all patients with drug-induced anaphylaxis, probably only a minority are associated with mast cell disease. Most of these cases in the literature are related to general anaesthesia. Thus, for patients with mastocytosis, general anaesthesia appears to be a procedure associated with risk of mast cell degranulation, and special precautions should be considered. The association between immediate drug hypersensitivity and undetected mast cell diseases appears to be moderate, but nevertheless basal serum tryptase determination and examination for skin signs of mast cell disorders are recommended.

The current World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) is essentially a lineage-oriented classification based on a presumable developmental tree of CNS. A four-tiered WHO grading scheme has been successfully applied to a spectrum of diffusely infiltrative astrocytomas, but it is not fully applicable to other gliomas, including oligodendrogliomas and ependymomas. Recent genetic studies have revealed that the major categories of gliomas, such as circumscribe astrocytomas, infiltrating astrocytomas/oligodendrogliomas, and glioblastoma, roughly correspond to major genetic alterations, including isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) 1/2 mutations, TP53 mutations, co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p/19q, and BRAF mutation/fusion. These genetic alterations are clinically significant in terms of the response to treatment(s) and/or the prognosis. It is, thus, rational that future classification of gliomas should be based on genotypes, rather than phenotypes, although the genetic features of each tumor are not sufficiently understood at present to draw a complete map of the gliomas, and genetic testing is not yet available worldwide, particularly in Asian and African countries. This review summarizes the current concepts of the WHO classification, as well as the current understanding of the major genetic alterations in glioma and the potential use of these alterations as diagnostic criteria.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Recent genetic studies have revealed that the major categories of gliomas, such as circumscribe astrocytomas, infiltrating astrocytomas/oligodendrogliomas, and glioblastoma, roughly correspond to major genetic alterations, including isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) 1/2 mutations, TP53 mutations, co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p/19q, and BRAF mutation/fusion.\", \"A four-tiered WHO grading scheme has been successfully applied to a spectrum of diffusely infiltrative astrocytomas, but it is not fully applicable to other gliomas, including oligodendrogliomas and ependymomas.\"]}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57).

PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) technology is a new protein-degradation strategy that has emerged in recent years. It uses bifunctional small molecules to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. PROTACs can not only be used as potential clinical treatments for diseases such as cancer, immune disorders, viral infections, and neurodegenerative diseases, but also provide unique chemical knockdown tools for biological research in a catalytic, reversible, and rapid manner. In 2019, our group published a review article \"PROTACs: great opportunities for academia and industry\" in the journal, summarizing the representative compounds of PROTACs reported before the end of 2019. In the past 2 years, the entire field of protein degradation has experienced rapid development, including not only a large increase in the number of research papers on protein-degradation technology but also a rapid increase in the number of small-molecule degraders that have entered the clinical and will enter the clinical stage. In addition to PROTAC and molecular glue technology, other new degradation technologies are also developing rapidly. In this article, we mainly summarize and review the representative PROTACs of related targets published in 2020-2021 to present to researchers the exciting developments in the field of protein degradation.

Anaphylaxis is the most severe form of allergic reaction, resulting from the effect of mediators and chemotactic substances released by activated cells. Mast cells and basophils are considered key players in IgE-mediated human anaphylaxis. Beyond IgE-mediated activation of mast cells/basophils, further mechanisms are involved in the occurrence of anaphylaxis. New insights into the potential relevance of pathways other than mast cell and basophil degranulation have been unraveled, such as the activation of the contact and the coagulation systems. Mast cell heparin released upon activation provides negatively charged surfaces for factor XII (FXII) binding and auto-activation. Activated FXII, the initiating serine protease in both the contact and the intrinsic coagulation system, activates factor XI and prekallikrein, respectively. FXII-mediated bradykinin (BK) formation has been proven in the human plasma of anaphylactic patients as well as in experimental models of anaphylaxis. Moreover, the severity of anaphylaxis is correlated with the increase in plasma heparin, BK formation and the intensity of contact system activation. FXII also activates plasminogen in the fibrinolysis system. Mast cell tryptase has been shown to participate in fibrinolysis through plasmin activation and by facilitating the degradation of fibrinogen. Some usual clinical manifestations in anaphylaxis, such as angioedema or hypotension, or other less common, such as metrorrhagia, may be explained by the direct effect of the activation of the coagulation and contact system driven by mast cell mediators.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Some usual clinical manifestations in anaphylaxis, such as angioedema or hypotension, or other less common, such as metrorrhagia, may be explained by the direct effect of the activation of the coagulation and contact system driven by mast cell mediators.\", \" Beyond IgE-mediated activation of mast cells/basophils, further mechanisms are involved in the occurrence of anaphylaxis.\"]}"}]}

The thymus is critical for central tolerance and diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire development, to provide lifelong defense against pathogens while maintaining self-tolerance. Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Administration of safe and effective iron therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease is a time consuming process. This phase II clinical trial studied ferumoxytol, a semi-synthetic carbohydrate-coated iron oxide administered by rapid intravenous injection to anemic chronic kidney disease patients (predialysis or undergoing peritoneal dialysis). Inclusion criteria included hemoglobin < or =12.5 g/dL and transferrin saturation < or =35%. Twenty-one adult patients were randomized to receive ferumoxytol in a regimen of 4 doses of 255 mg iron in 2 weeks or 2 doses of 510 mg iron in 1 to 2 weeks. Ferumoxytol was administered at a rate of up to 30 mg iron/sec. The maximum hemoglobin response following ferumoxytol administration occurred at 6 weeks, increasing from a baseline of 10.4 +/- 1.3 g/dL to 11.4 +/- 1.2 g/dL (P < 0.05). Ferritin increased from a baseline of 232 +/- 216 ng/mL to a maximum of 931 +/- 361 ng/mL at 2 weeks (P < 0.05), while the baseline transferrin saturation increased from 21 +/- 10% to 37 +/- 22% at 1 week (P < 0.05). Seven adverse events in 5 patients during this trial were deemed possibly related to ferumoxytol, none serious. These events included constipation, chills, tingling, a gastrointestinal viral syndrome, delayed pruritic erythematous rash, and transient pain at the injection site. Although larger studies are required, this small study demonstrates that ferumoxytol can be safe and effective in increasing iron stores, is associated with an increased hemoglobin response, and is well tolerated at a rapid infusion rate.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"safety and efficacy of ferumoxytol therapy in anemic chronic kidney disease patients.\"]}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the prototype of primary humoral immunodeficiencies. Long-term follow-up studies regarding disease-related complications and outcome are scarce. Our aim was to describe the natural history of XLA. A nationwide multicenter study based on the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry was established in 2000 in Italy. Affected patients were enrolled by documenting centers, and the patients' laboratory, clinical, and imaging data were recorded on an annual base. Data on the patients (N\u00a0= 168) were derived from a cumulative follow-up of 1370 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 8.35 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis decreased after establishment of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry (84 months before vs 23 months after). Respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent clinical symptoms at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Regular immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduced the incidence of invasive infections. Affected patients developed chronic lung disease over time (47% after 40 years of follow-up) in the presence of chronic sinusitis (84%). Malignancies were documented in a minority of cases (3.7%). Overall survival for affected patients was significantly reduced when compared with that for the healthy male Italian population, and it further deteriorated in the presence of chronic lung disease. This is the first detailed long-term follow-up study for patients with XLA, revealing that although immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduces the incidence of invasive infections, it does not appear to influence the development of chronic lung disease. The overall survival of affected patients is reduced. Further studies are warranted to improve patients' clinical management and increase awareness among physicians.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) is emerging as a promising strategy for targeted protein degradation. However, the drug development using the heterobifunctional PROTAC molecules is generally limited by poor membrane permeability, low in vivo efficacy and indiscriminate distribution. Herein an aptamer-PROTAC conjugation approach was developed as a novel strategy to improve the tumor-specific targeting ability and in vivo antitumor potency of conventional PROTACs. As proof of concept, the first aptamer-PROTAC conjugate (APC) was designed by conjugating a BET-targeting PROTAC to the nucleic acid aptamer AS1411 (AS) via a cleavable linker. Compared with the unmodified BET PROTAC, the designed molecule (APR) showed improved tumor targeting ability in a MCF-7 xenograft model, leading to enhanced in vivo BET degradation and antitumor potency and decreased toxicity. Thus, the APC strategy may pave the way for the design of tumor-specific targeting PROTACs and have broad applications in the development of PROTAC-based drugs.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) is emerging as a promising strategy for targeted protein degradation.

Limited data suggest that iron deficiency is common in patients with chronic kidney disease with anemia; this lack of iron can hinder the effectiveness of erythropoiesis. The diagnosis of iron deficiency should involve clinical judgment, with an emphasis on clinical characteristics of the patient because of the limited amount of literature examining the interpretation of iron testing results. When iron deficiency is diagnosed in nondialysis patients with chronic kidney disease, a search must be initiated for any sources of blood loss. After addressing any blood loss, the preferred route of iron treatment must be determined. To date, no clear advantage was shown with intravenous versus oral administration in nondialysis patients, as shown in the hemodialysis setting.

The chaperonin GroEL is a megadalton-sized molecular machine that plays an essential role in the bacterial cell assisting protein folding to the native state through actions requiring ATP binding and hydrolysis. A combination of medicinal chemistry and genetics has been employed to generate an orthogonal pair, a small molecule that selectively inhibits ATPase activity of a GroEL ATP-binding pocket variant. An initial screen of kinase-directed inhibitors identified an active pyrazolo-pyrimidine scaffold that was iteratively modified and screened against a collective of GroEL nucleotide pocket variants to identify a cyclopentyl carboxamide derivative, EC3016, that specifically inhibits ATPase activity and protein folding by the GroEL mutant, I493C, involving a side chain positioned near the base of ATP. This orthogonal pair will enable in vitro studies of the action of ATP in triggering activation of GroEL-mediated protein folding and might enable further studies of GroEL action in vivo. The approach originated for studying kinases by Shokat and his colleagues may thus also be used to study large macromolecular machines.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water. Our data suggest that AGE-RAGE may play a key role in venous intimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus and aminoguanidine suppressed intimal hyperplasia by inhibiting this pathway.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The North Star Ambulatory Assessment measures motor performance in ambulatory boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a hereditary and degenerative muscle disorder. To use the North Star Ambulatory Assessment in Brazilian boys, we performed the cross-cultural adaptation to the Portuguese language spoken in Brazil and evaluated the reliability and validity of the instrument. Cross-cultural adaptation included: independent translations, synthesis, committee review, pre-testing in 12 boys, back-translation and comparison with the original instrument. Thirty-five boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and 38 healthy age-matched controls were recruited for further analyses. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency and reproducibility. Validity studies included face, content, construct and known-groups analyses. Cross-cultural adaptation resulted in an adequate instrument. Reliability studies demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha\u2009=\u20090.935) and adequate intra and inter-rater reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient\u2009=\u20090.988 and 0.962).

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Assessing prognosis for acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure (APAP-ALF) patients often presents significant challenges. King's College (KCC) has been validated on hospital admission, but little has been published on later phases of illness. We aimed to improve determinations of prognosis both at the time of and following admission for APAP-ALF using Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models. CART models were applied to US ALFSG registry data to predict 21-day death or liver transplant early (on admission) and post-admission (days 3-7) for 803 APAP-ALF patients enrolled 01/1998-09/2013. Accuracy in prediction of outcome (AC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), and area under receiver-operating curve (AUROC) were compared between 3 models: KCC (INR, creatinine, coma grade, pH), CART analysis using only KCC variables (KCC-CART) and a CART model using new variables (NEW-CART). Traditional KCC yielded 69% AC, 90% SP, 27% SN, and 0.58 AUROC on admission, with similar performance post-admission. KCC-CART at admission offered predictive 66% AC, 65% SP, 67% SN, and 0.74 AUROC. Post-admission, KCC-CART had predictive 82% AC, 86% SP, 46% SN and 0.81 AUROC. NEW-CART models using MELD (Model for end stage liver disease), lactate and mechanical ventilation on admission yielded predictive 72% AC, 71% SP, 77% SN and AUROC 0.79. For later stages, NEW-CART (MELD, lactate, coma grade) offered predictive AC 86%, SP 91%, SN 46%, AUROC 0.73. CARTs offer simple prognostic models for APAP-ALF patients, which have higher AUROC and SN than KCC, with similar AC and negligibly worse SP.

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33\u2009IU/l for males, 19 to 25\u2009IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"ase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin.

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC-D) is an X-linked metabolic disease and the most common urea cycle disorder. Due to high phenotypic heterogeneity, ranging from lethal neonatal hyperammonemic events to moderate symptoms and even asymptomatic individuals, the prediction of the disease course at an early disease stage is very important to individually adjust therapies such as medical treatment or liver transplantation. In this translational study, we developed a severity-adjusted classification system based on in\u00a0vitro residual enzymatic OTC activity. Applying a cell-based expression system, residual enzymatic OTC activities of 71 pathogenic OTC variants were spectrophotometrically determined and subsequently correlated with clinical and biochemical outcome parameters of 119 male individuals with OTC-D (mOTC-D) as reported in the UCDC and E-IMD registries. Integration of multiple data sources enabled the establishment of a robust disease prediction model for mOTC-D. Residual enzymatic OTC activity not only correlates with age at first symptoms, initial peak plasma ammonium concentration and frequency of metabolic decompensations but also predicts mortality. The critical threshold of 4.3% residual enzymatic activity distinguishes a severe from an attenuated phenotype. Residual enzymatic OTC activity reliably predicts the disease severity in mOTC-D and could thus serve as a tool for severity-adjusted evaluation of therapeutic strategies and counselling patients and parents.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC-D) is an X-linked metabolic disease and the most common urea cycle disorder.

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65.

Studies of developmental prosopagnosia have often shown that developmental prosopagnosia differentially affects human face processing over non-face object processing. However, little consideration has been given to whether this condition is associated with perceptual or sensorimotor impairments in other modalities. Comorbidities have played a role in theories of other developmental disorders such as dyslexia, but studies of developmental prosopagnosia have often focused on the nature of the visual recognition impairment despite evidence for widespread neural anomalies that might affect other sensorimotor systems. We studied 12 subjects with developmental prosopagnosia with a battery of auditory tests evaluating pitch and rhythm processing as well as voice perception and recognition. Overall, three subjects were impaired in fine pitch discrimination, a prevalence of 25% that is higher than the estimated 4% prevalence of congenital amusia in the general population. This was a selective deficit, as rhythm perception was unaffected in all 12 subjects. Furthermore, two of the three prosopagnosic subjects who were impaired in pitch discrimination had intact voice perception and recognition, while two of the remaining nine subjects had impaired voice recognition but intact pitch perception. These results indicate that, in some subjects with developmental prosopagnosia, the face recognition deficit is not an isolated impairment but is associated with deficits in other domains, such as auditory perception. These deficits may form part of a broader syndrome which could be due to distributed microstructural anomalies in various brain networks, possibly with a common theme of right hemispheric predominance.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"These results indicate that, in some subjects with developmental prosopagnosia, the face recognition deficit is not an isolated impairment but is associated with deficits in other domains, such as auditory perception.\"]}"}]}

The chaperonin GroEL is a megadalton-sized molecular machine that plays an essential role in the bacterial cell assisting protein folding to the native state through actions requiring ATP binding and hydrolysis. A combination of medicinal chemistry and genetics has been employed to generate an orthogonal pair, a small molecule that selectively inhibits ATPase activity of a GroEL ATP-binding pocket variant. An initial screen of kinase-directed inhibitors identified an active pyrazolo-pyrimidine scaffold that was iteratively modified and screened against a collective of GroEL nucleotide pocket variants to identify a cyclopentyl carboxamide derivative, EC3016, that specifically inhibits ATPase activity and protein folding by the GroEL mutant, I493C, involving a side chain positioned near the base of ATP. This orthogonal pair will enable in vitro studies of the action of ATP in triggering activation of GroEL-mediated protein folding and might enable further studies of GroEL action in vivo.

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the prototype of primary humoral immunodeficiencies. Long-term follow-up studies regarding disease-related complications and outcome are scarce. Our aim was to describe the natural history of XLA. A nationwide multicenter study based on the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry was established in 2000 in Italy. Affected patients were enrolled by documenting centers, and the patients' laboratory, clinical, and imaging data were recorded on an annual base. Data on the patients (N\u00a0= 168) were derived from a cumulative follow-up of 1370 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 8.35 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis decreased after establishment of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry (84 months before vs 23 months after). Respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent clinical symptoms at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Regular immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduced the incidence of invasive infections. Affected patients developed chronic lung disease over time (47% after 40 years of follow-up) in the presence of chronic sinusitis (84%). Malignancies were documented in a minority of cases (3.7%). Overall survival for affected patients was significantly reduced when compared with that for the healthy male Italian population, and it further deteriorated in the presence of chronic lung disease. This is the first detailed long-term follow-up study for patients with XLA, revealing that although immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduces the incidence of invasive infections, it does not appear to influence the development of chronic lung disease. The overall survival of affected patients is reduced. Further studies are warranted to improve patients' clinical management and increase awareness among physicians.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Microexons (\u226427 nt) play critical roles in nervous system development and function but create unique challenges for the splicing machinery. The mechanisms of microexon regulation are therefore of great interest. We performed a genetic screen for alternative splicing regulators in the C.\u00a0elegans nervous system and identify PRP-40, a core component of the U1 snRNP. RNA-seq reveals that PRP-40 is required for inclusion of alternatively spliced, but not constitutively spliced, exons. PRP-40 is particularly required for inclusion of neuronal microexons, and our data indicate that PRP-40 is a central regulator of microexon splicing. Microexons can be relieved from PRP-40 dependence by artificially increasing exon size or reducing flanking intron size, indicating that PRP-40 is specifically required for microexons surrounded by conventionally sized introns. Knockdown of the orthologous PRPF40A in mouse neuroblastoma cells causes widespread dysregulation of microexons but not conventionally sized exons. PRP-40 regulation of neuronal microexons is therefore a widely conserved phenomenon.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"PRP-40 regulation of neuronal microexons is therefore a widely conserved phenomenon.\"]}"}]}

In clinical routine, adverse drug reactions (ADR) are common, and they should be included in the differential diagnosis in all patients undergoing drug treatment. Only part of those ADR are immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions and thus true drug allergies. Far more common are non-immune-mediated ADR, e.g. due to the pharmacological properties of the drug or to the individual predisposition of the patient (enzymopathies, cytokine dysbalance, mast cell hyperreactivity). In true drug allergiesT cell- and immunoglobulin E (lgE)-mediated reactions dominate the clinical presentation. T cell-mediated ADR usually have a delayed appearance and include skin eruptions in most cases. Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that they may involve systemic T cell activation and thus take a severe, sometimes lethal turn. Clinical danger signs are involvement of mucosal surfaces, blistering within the exanthematous skin areas and systemic symptoms, e.g. fever or malaise. Drug presentation via antigen-presenting cells to T cells can either involve the classical pathway of haptenization of endogenous proteins or be directly mediated via noncovalent binding to immune receptors (MHC molecules or T cell receptors), the so-called p-i concept. Flare-up reactions during the acute phase of T cell-mediated ADR should not be mistaken for true drug allergies, as they only occur in the setting of a highly activated T cell pool. IgE-mediated ADR are less frequent and involve mast cells and/or basophils as peripheral effector cells. Recent data suggest that certain patients with drug allergy have a preexistent sensitization although they have never been exposed to the culprit drug, probably due to cross-reactivity. Thus, allergic drug reactions on first encounter are possible. In general, the extent of cross-reactivity is higher in IgE-compared to T cell-mediated ADR. Based on a specific ethnic background and only for severe T cell-mediated ADR to certain drugs, a strong HLA association has been established recently.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Drug presentation via antigen-presenting cells to T cells can either involve the classical pathway of haptenization of endogenous proteins or be directly mediated via noncovalent binding to immune receptors (MHC molecules or T cell receptors), t\"]}"}]}

Herein, long-term (>2 years) functional outcomes in viltolarsen treated patients were compared to a matched historical control group. To evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of the anti-sense oligonucleotide viltolarsen in the treatment of patients with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping therapy.

Both groups were treated with glucocorticoids. All 16 participants elected to enroll in this long-term trial (up to 192 weeks) to continue evaluation of motor function and safety. Time to stand from supine and time to run/walk 10 meters showed stabilization from baseline through week 109 for viltolarsen-treated participants whereas the historical control group showed decline (statistically significant differences for multiple timepoints). Safety was similar to that observed in the previous 24-week trial, which was predominantly mild. There have been no treatment-related serious adverse events and no discontinuations. Based on these results at over 2 years, viltolarsen can be a new treatment option for patients with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"esulting in an absence of functional dystrophin protein.

To summarise, we detected an increased HCC risk in rs4646421 variant carriers (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.61) and rs2198843 variant carriers (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.69), and a reduced risk of HCC (OR 0.70. 95% CI 0.52-0.94) associated with homozygote carriers of rs4886605 variant. These association signals were also observed in non-smokers with rs4646421 (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.16-2.08) and rs4886605 (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.91). Compared to the most common CYP1A1 haplotype CCAG, the haplotype TTGC conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.52). Similarly, the TTGC/TTGC diplotype conferred an increased risk of HCC compared with diplotype CCAG/CCAG (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.23-3.45, P=0.006). Interestingly, the diplotype TTAC/CCAG also conferred an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.22-2.54, P=0.003). Our results suggested that common genetic variants in CYP1A1 may modulate the risk of developing HCC in the study population, particularly in non-smokers. However, our findings need to be validated in at least one independent study of Han Chinese population.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses.

Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are molecules that induce protein degradation via formation of ternary complexes between an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a target protein. The rational design of PROTACs requires accurate knowledge of the native configuration of the PROTAC-induced ternary complex. This study demonstrates that native and non-native ternary complex poses can be distinguished based on the pose occupancy time in MD, where native poses exhibit longer occupancy times at both room and higher temperatures. Candidate poses are generated by MD sampling and pre-ranked by classic MM/GBSA. A specific heating scheme is then applied to accelerate ternary pose departure, with the pose occupancy time and fraction being measured. This scoring identifies the native pose in all systems tested. Its success is partially attributed to the dynamic nature of pose departure analyses, which accounts for entropic effects typically neglected in the faster static scoring methods, while entropy plays a greater role in protein-protein than in protein-ligand systems.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are molecules that induce protein degradation via formation of ternary complexes between an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a target protein. \"]}"}]}

Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize someone by the face alone in the absence of sensory or intellectual impairment. In contrast to the acquired form of prosopagnosia we studied the congenital form. Since we could recently show that this form is inherited as a simple monogenic trait we called it hereditary form. To determine whether not only face recognition and neuronal processing but also the perceptual acquisition of facial information is specific to prosopagnosia, we studied the gaze behaviour of four hereditary prosopagnosics in comparison to matched control subjects. This rarely studied form of prosopagnosia ensures that deficits are limited to face recognition. Whereas the control participants focused their gaze on the central facial features, the hereditary prosopagnosics showed a significantly different gaze behaviour. They had a more dispersed gaze and also fixated external facial features. Thus, the face recognition impairment of the hereditary prosopagnosics is reflected in their gaze behaviour.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" This rarely studied form of prosopagnosia ensures that deficits are limited to face recognition.\", \"Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize someone by the face alone in the absence of sensory or intellectual impairment.

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Programmed death 1 (PD-1), an inhibitory receptor expressed on activated lymphocytes, regulates tolerance and autoimmunity. PD-1 has two ligands: PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is expressed broadly on hematopoietic and parenchymal cells, including pancreatic islet cells; and PD-L2, which is restricted to macrophages and dendritic cells. To investigate whether PD-L1 and PD-L2 have synergistic or unique roles in regulating T cell activation and tolerance, we generated mice lacking PD-L1 and PD-L2 (PD-L1/PD-L2(-/-) mice) and compared them to mice lacking either PD-L. PD-L1 and PD-L2 have overlapping functions in inhibiting interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma production during T cell activation. However, PD-L1 has a unique and critical role in controlling self-reactive T cells in the pancreas. Our studies with bone marrow chimeras demonstrate that PD-L1/PD-L2 expression only on antigen-presenting cells is insufficient to prevent the early onset diabetes that develops in PD-L1/PD-L2(-/-) non-obese diabetic mice. PD-L1 expression in islets protects against immunopathology after transplantation of syngeneic islets into diabetic recipients. PD-L1 inhibits pathogenic self-reactive CD4+ T cell-mediated tissue destruction and effector cytokine production. These data provide evidence that PD-L1 expression on parenchymal cells rather than hematopoietic cells protects against autoimmune diabetes and point to a novel role for PD-1-PD-L1 interactions in mediating tissue tolerance.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"PD-1 has two ligands: PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is expressed broadly on hematopoietic and parenchymal cells, including pancreatic islet cells; and PD-L2, which is restricted to macrophages and dendritic cells.\"]}"}]}

Several new approaches to gene therapy for the muscular dystrophies involve oligonucleotides as targeting vectors. These oligonucleotides are designed to repair genetic mutations, to modify genomic sequences in order to compensate for gene deletions, or to modify RNA processing in order to ameliorate the effects of the underlying gene mutation. Among the various approaches currently under investigation for dystrophin mutations that cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the use of chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides (\"chimeraplasts\") to repair point mutations. Studies in the mdx mouse and the GRMD dog have demonstrated that point mutations in the dystrophin gene can be corrected by chimeraplasts that have been injected into muscles. The scope of this review includes a summary of the current status of chimeraplast-mediated gene repair for dystrophin mutations, ongoing studies to apply chimeraplast-mediated gene repair to frame-shift deletions of the dystrophin gene, and major hurdles that need to be overcome to translate current experimental successes into a viable therapeutic modality for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Several new approaches to gene therapy for the muscular dystrophies involve oligonucleotides as targeting vectors.\"]}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects.

Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. Although mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of renal anemia include chronic inflammation, iron deficiency, and shortened half-life of erythrocytes, the primary cause is deficiency of erythropoietin (EPO). Serum EPO levels in patients with chronic kidney disease are usually within the normal range and thus fail to show an appropriate increase with decreasing hemoglobin levels, as found in nonrenal anemias. Studies elucidating the regulation of EPO expression led to the identification of the hypoxia inducible factor-hypoxia responsive element system. However, despite much progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms through which cells can sense oxygen availability and translate this information into altered gene expression, the reason why EPO production is inappropriately low in diseased kidneys remains incompletely understood. Both alterations in the function of EPO-producing cells and perturbations of the oxygen-sensing mechanism in the kidney may contribute. As with other anemias, the consequences of renal anemia are a moderate decrease in tissue oxygen tensions and counterregulatory mechanisms that maintain total oxygen consumption, including a persistent increase in cardiac output.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease.\"]}"}]}

Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the activity of thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide in multiple myeloma (MM), including demonstrable anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory effects, the precise cellular targets and molecular mechanisms have only recently become clear. A landmark study recently identified cereblon (CRBN) as a primary target of thalidomide teratogenicity. Subsequently it was demonstrated that CRBN is also required for the anti-myeloma activity of thalidomide and related drugs, the so-called immune-modulatory drugs (IMiDs). Low CRBN expression was found to correlate with drug resistance in MM cell lines and primary MM cells. One of the downstream targets of CRBN identified is interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), which is critical for myeloma cell survival and is down-regulated by IMiD treatment. CRBN is also implicated in several effects of IMiDs, such as down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and T cell immunomodulatory activity, demonstrating that the pleotropic actions of the IMiDs are initiated by binding to CRBN. Future dissection of CRBN downstream signaling will help to delineate the underlying mechanisms for IMiD action and eventually lead to development of new drugs with more specific anti-myeloma activities. It may also provide a biomarker to predict IMiD response and resistance.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"dy recently identified cereblon (CRBN) as a primary target of thalidomide teratogenicity.

To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Teclistamab is a T-cell-redirecting bispecific antibody that targets both CD3 expressed on the surface of T cells and B-cell maturation antigen expressed on the surface of myeloma cells. In the phase 1 dose-defining portion of the study, teclistamab showed promising efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In this phase 1-2 study, we enrolled patients who had relapsed or refractory myeloma after at least three therapy lines, including triple-class exposure to an immunomodulatory drug, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody. Patients received a weekly subcutaneous injection of teclistamab (at a dose of 1.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) after receiving step-up doses of 0.06 mg and 0.3 mg per kilogram. The primary end point was the overall response (partial response or better). Among 165 patients who received teclistamab, 77.6% had triple-class refractory disease (median, five previous therapy lines). With a median follow-up of 14.1 months, the overall response rate was 63.0%, with 65 patients (39.4%) having a complete response or better. A total of 44 patients (26.7%) were found to have no minimal residual disease (MRD); the MRD-negativity rate among the patients with a complete response or better was 46%. The median duration of response was 18.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.9 to not estimable). The median duration of progression-free survival was 11.3 months (95% CI, 8.8 to 17.1). Common adverse events included cytokine release syndrome (in 72.1% of the patients; grade 3, 0.6%; no grade 4), neutropenia (in 70.9%; grade 3 or 4, 64.2%), anemia (in 52.1%; grade 3 or 4, 37.0%), and thrombocytopenia (in 40.0%; grade 3 or 4, 21.2%). Infections were frequent (in 76.4%; grade 3 or 4, 44.8%). Neurotoxic events occurred in 24 patients (14.5%), including immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome in 5 patients (3.0%; all grade 1 or 2). Teclistamab resulted in a high rate of deep and durable response in patients with triple-class-exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Cytopenias and infections were common; toxic effects that were consistent with T-cell redirection were mostly grade 1 or 2.

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group.

In recent years, prosopagnosia is defined as the \"loss of ability to recognize the well-acquainted persons like the family members by their physiognomy.\" There are many reports based on this definition. However, from the viewpoint of symptomatology, there are many problems not entirely solved yet. And the mechanism of its manifestation is not clearly explained. Topographic disorientation, which often accompanies prosopagnosia, is studied even less. From the results of the postmortem examination in the literature, bilateral occipito-temporal lesions have been known to cause prosopagnosia. However, the recent radiographical examination by the computed tomography revealed that the prosopagnosia is also caused by the right occipito-temporal lesions only. We experienced a case with prosopagnosia and topographic disorientation which were considered to be caused by infarction in the territory of the right posterior cerebral artery. Detailed symptomatological, morphological and functional examinations were carried out by means of various psychological testing, X-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). The patient was a 70-year-old right-handed man who suffered from sudden visual loss on both eyes, and was admitted to our hospital after four weeks. On examination, a decrease of visual acuity and right homonymous hemianopsia were recognized. When visual acuity was recovered, he was unable to recognize the faces of his relatives and friends, with whom he has been well acquainted for many years. He also found his own house, the buildings and streets around it as entirely unfamiliar. Seven months after the onset of the disease, examination showed he had definite prosopagnosia and topographic disorientation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"In recent years, prosopagnosia is defined as the \\\"loss of ability to recognize the well-acquainted persons like the family members by their physiognomy.\\\"\"]}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Anemia is a very common clinical problem in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in these patients. Erythropoietin is a hormone synthesized that is deficient in the majority of patients with advanced kidney disease, thereby predisposing these patients to anemia. The other cause of anemia is deficiency of iron. Iron deficiency anemia is common in people with CKD and its importance in supporting erythropoiesis is unquestioned, especially in those patients treated with erythropoietin. Intravenous iron is frequently used to treat anemia in CKD patients and is very efficacious in increasing hemoglobin but at the same time there are some safety issues associated with it. The objective of this review is to assess the frequency of adverse drug events associated with four different iron formulations: two iron dextran products known as high and low molecular weight iron dextran, iron sucrose, and sodium ferric gluconate complex. Several electronic databases were searched. In general, with the exception of high molecular weight iron dextran, serious or life-threatening adverse events appeared rare. Iron sucrose has the least reported adverse events and high molecular weight iron dextran has the highest number of reported adverse events. Low molecular weight iron dextran and ferric gluconate fall in between these two for number of adverse drug events.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"o anemia.

Anemia in chronic kidney disease is common and iron deficiency is an important cause. To repair iron-deficiency anemia, replacement of iron is needed. Iron can be replaced either by the oral route or by the intravenous route. In a meta-analysis, 5 of the 6 trials were short-term, 1 to 3 months, and compared to oral iron, the mean increase in hemoglobin with intravenous iron was only 0.31 g/dL. However, one of the studies included in this meta-analysis was 6 months long and had a mean decline in hemoglobin of 0.52 g/dL associated with intravenous iron administration. Given the short duration of most of the clinical trials comparing oral with intravenous administration of iron the long-term safety of these modes of administration of supplemental iron could not be assessed. Replacement of iron by the oral route is associated with mostly minor complications such as black stools, constipation, and abdominal discomfort. In contrast, intravenous administration of iron may lead to severe adverse events such as anaphylaxis and, as a more recent randomized trial has suggested, delayed complications such as infections and cardiovascular disease. Delayed complications of repeated intravenous iron use are difficult to recognize at an individual level therefore inpatients who have had recent cardiovascular events or are infected, intravenous iron should probably be avoided. Balancing safety and efficacy would require clinical judgment because 1 size may not fit all till we have better data to support the liberal use of parenteral iron.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Anemia in chronic kidney disease is common and iron deficiency is an important cause.\"]}"}]}

Polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S underlies the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD). In activating red blood cell pyruvate kinase and glycolysis, mitapivat (AG-348) increases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and decreases the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentration, an upstream precursor in glycolysis. Both changes have therapeutic potential for patients with SCD. Here, we evaluated the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of mitapivat in adults with SCD with no recent blood transfusions or changes in hydroxyurea or l-glutamine therapy. Seventeen subjects were enrolled; 1 subject was withdrawn shortly after starting the study. Sixteen subjects completed 3 ascending dose levels of mitapivat (5, 20, and 50 mg, twice daily [BID]) for 2\u00a0weeks each; following a protocol amendment, the dose was escalated to 100 mg BID in 9 subjects. Mitapivat was well tolerated at all dose levels, with the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) being insomnia, headache, and hypertension. Six serious AEs (SAEs) included 4 vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), non-VOC-related shoulder pain, and a preexisting pulmonary embolism. Two VOCs occurred during drug taper and were possibly drug related; no other SAEs were drug related. Mean hemoglobin increase at the 50 mg BID dose level was 1.2 g/dL, with 9 of 16 (56.3%) patients achieving a hemoglobin response of a \u22651 g/dL increase compared with baseline. Mean reductions in hemolytic markers and dose-dependent decreases in 2,3-DPG and increases in ATP were also observed.

Patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (NTDT), although they do not require regular blood transfusions for survival, can still accrue a heavy burden of comorbidities. No approved disease-modifying therapies exist for these patients. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of mitapivat (Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA), a pyruvate kinase activator, in adults with non-transfusion-dependent (NTD) \u03b1-thalassaemia or NTD \u03b2-thalassaemia. In this open-label, multicentre, phase 2 study, patients were recruited from four academic clinical study sites in Oakland, CA, and Boston, MA, USA; Toronto, ON, Canada; and London, UK. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, with NTDT (including \u03b2-thalassaemia with or without \u03b1-globin gene mutations, haemoglobin E \u03b2-thalassaemia, or \u03b1-thalassaemia), and a baseline haemoglobin concentration of 10\u00b70 g/dL or lower. During a 24-week core period, mitapivat was administered orally at 50 mg twice daily for the first 6 weeks followed by an escalation to 100 mg twice daily for 18 weeks thereafter. The primary endpoint was haemoglobin response (a \u22651\u00b70 g/dL increase in haemoglobin concentration from baseline at one or more assessments between weeks 4 and 12). Efficacy and safety were assessed in the full analysis set (ie, all patients who received at least one dose of study drug). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03692052, and is closed to accrual. Between Dec 28, 2018, and Feb 6, 2020, 27 patients were screened, of whom 20 were enrolled (15 [75%] with \u03b2-thalassaemia and five [25%] with \u03b1-thalassaemia) and received mitapivat. The median age of patients was 44 years (IQR 35-56), 15 (75%) of 20 patients were female, five (25%) were male, and ten (50%) identified as Asian. 16 (80% [90% CI 60-93]) of 20 patients had a haemoglobin response (p<0\u00b70001), five (100%) of five with \u03b1-thalassaemia and 11 (73%) of 15 with \u03b2-thalassaemia. 17 (85%) patients had a treatment-emergent adverse event, and 13 had a treatment-emergent event that was considered to be treatment related. One serious treatment-emergent adverse event occurred (grade 3 renal impairment), which was considered unrelated to study drug, resulting in discontinuation of treatment. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events were initial insomnia (ten [50%] patients), dizziness (six [30%]), and headache (five [25%]). No patients died during the 24-week core period.

Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) degrade target proteins by engaging the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Assays detecting target-PROTAC-E3 ligase ternary complexes are critical for PROTAC development. Both time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) assays and amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assays can characterize ternary complexes and assess PROTAC efficacy; stepwise optimization protocols for these assays are lacking. To identify assay conditions that can be applied to various targets and PROTACs, we used a stepwise approach to optimize a TR-FRET assay of BRD2(BD1)/PROTACs/CRBN ternary complexes. This assay is sensitive and specific and responds to the bivalent PROTACs dBET1, PROTAC BET Degrader-1, and PROTAC BET Degrader-2 but not to non-PROTAC ligands of BRD2(BD1) or CRBN. The activity rank order of dBET1, PROTAC BET Degrader-1, and PROTAC BET Degrader-2 in the TR-FRET assay corresponded with previously reported cell growth inhibition assays, indicating the effectiveness of our assay for predicting PROTAC cellular activity. The TR-FRET ternary complex formation assay for BRD2(BD1)/PROTAC/CRBN can be configured to characterize the binding activities of BRD2(BD1) and CRBN ligands with the same compound activity rank order as that of previously reported binary binding assays for individual targets but with the advantage of simultaneously assessing the ligand activities for both targets. Our assay is modular in nature, as BRD2(BD1) can be replaced with other BRDs and successfully detect ternary complexes without modifying other assay conditions. Therefore, the TR-FRET ternary complex assay for BRDs provides a general assay protocol for establishing assays for other targets and bivalent molecules.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) degrade target proteins by engaging the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

There is an urgent unmet need for new therapies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, levosimendan, a calcium sensitiser, was shown to improve neuromechanical efficiency and contractile function of the human diaphragm. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral levosimendan in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, with a focus on respiratory function. The REFALS study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial at 99 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis specialist centres in 14 countries worldwide. People with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were eligible for participation if they were at least 18 years of age and had a sitting slow vital capacity (SVC) of 60-90% predicted. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) by interactive web-response system to receive either levosimendan or placebo. The capsules for oral administration were identical in appearance to maintain blinding of participants and investigators. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in supine SVC at 12 weeks, assessed as the percentage of predicted normal sitting SVC. The key secondary endpoint was the combined assessment of function and survival (CAFS) up to 48 weeks. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, comprising all participants who were randomly assigned. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03505021) and has been completed. An extension study (REFALS-ES; NCT03948178) has also been completed, but will be reported separately. Between June 21, 2018, and June 28, 2019, 871 people were screened for the study, of whom 496 were randomly assigned either levosimendan (n=329) or placebo (n=167). Participants were followed up between June 27, 2018 and June 26, 2020, for a median duration of 50\u00b71 (IQR 37\u00b75-51\u00b71) weeks. The median duration of treatment was 47\u00b79 (IQR 26\u00b74-48\u00b71) weeks. Change from baseline in supine SVC at 12 weeks was -6\u00b773% with levosimendan and -6\u00b799% with placebo, with no significant difference between the treatments (estimated treatment difference 0\u00b726%, 95% CI -2\u00b703 to 2\u00b755, p=0\u00b783). Similarly, at week 48, CAFS did not differ between treatment groups (least squares mean change from baseline 10\u00b769, 95% CI -15\u00b774 to 37\u00b712; nominal p value=0\u00b743). The most frequent adverse events were increased heart rate (106 [33%] of 326 receiving levosimendan vs 12 [7%] of 166 receiving placebo), fall (85 [26%] vs 48 [29%]), headache (93 [29%] vs 36 [22%]), and dyspnoea (59 [18%] vs 32 [19%]). 33 (10%) participants allocated levosimendan and 20 (12%) assigned placebo died during the trial, mainly due to respiratory failure or progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Levosimendan was not superior to placebo in maintaining respiratory function in a broad population with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although levosimendan was generally well tolerated, increased heart rate and headache occurred more frequently with levosimendan than with placebo. The possibility of a clinically relevant subgroup of responsive individuals requires further evaluation.

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no cure, and available treatments are only able to postpone the progression of the disease. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be a transitional stage preceding AD. Therefore, prediction models for conversion from MCI to AD are desperately required. These will allow early treatment of patients with MCI before they develop AD. This study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the reported risk prediction models and identify the most prevalent factors for conversion from MCI to AD. We systematically reviewed the studies from the databases of PubMed, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library, which were searched through September 2021. Two reviewers independently identified eligible articles and extracted the data. We used the Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modeling Studies (CHARMS) checklist for the risk of bias assessment. In total, 18 articles describing the prediction models for conversion from MCI to AD were identified. The dementia conversion rate of elderly patients with MCI ranged from 14.49 to 87%. Models in 12 studies were developed using the data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). C-index/area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of development models were 0.67-0.98, and the validation models were 0.62-0.96. MRI, apolipoprotein E genotype 4 (APOE4), older age, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive (ADAS-cog) score were the most common and strongest predictors included in the models. In this systematic review, many prediction models have been developed and have good predictive performance, but the lack of external validation of models limited the extensive application in the general population. In clinical practice, it is recommended that medical professionals adopt a comprehensive forecasting method rather than a single predictive factor to screen patients with a high risk of MCI. Future research should pay attention to the improvement, calibration, and validation of existing models while considering new variables, new methods, and differences in risk profiles across populations.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modeling Studies (CHARMS)\", \"acted the data.

Intimal hyperplasia is one of the major pathological processes in vein graft failure with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the suppressive effect of aminoguanidine on intimal hyperplasia is mediated by downregulated expression of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To induce intimal hyperplasia, autologous external jugular vein was grafted into the infrarenal abdominal aorta in 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats. In diabetic rats, distilled water with or without aminoguanidine was administrated, whereas nondiabetic rats were given distilled water alone. Vein grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 weeks after surgery for morphological analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for RAGE and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65. Serum AGE level was determined by fluorospectrophotometry. Compared to nondiabetic rats, serum levels of AGE in diabetic rats administrated distilled water were significantly increased. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB p65, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly increased in the vein graft. In diabetic rats treated with aminoguanidine, serum AGE level NF-kappaB p65 expression, the ratio of intima to media area, and the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in the vein graft were all significantly decreased. However, no difference in the expression of RAGE was found compared to the diabetic group given distilled water.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral levosimendan in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, three-period study with 6 months open-label follow-up enrolled adults with ALS and sitting slow vital capacity (SVC) 60%-90 % of predicted from 11 sites in four countries. Patients received levosimendan 1\u2009mg daily, 1\u2009mg two times a day or placebo during three 14-day crossover periods and levosimendan 1-2\u2009mg daily during open-label follow-up. Primary endpoint was sitting SVC; secondary endpoints included supine SVC, ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), tolerability and safety. Of 66 patients randomised, 59 contributed to the double-blind results and 50 entered open-label follow-up. Sitting SVC was not significantly different between the treatments. In post hoc analysis using period-wise baselines, supine SVC favoured levosimendan over placebo, estimated mean differences from baseline being -3.62% on placebo, +0.77% on levosimendan 1\u2009mg daily (p=0.018) and +2.38% on 1\u2009mg two times a day (p=0.001). Headache occurred in 16.7% of patients during levosimendan 1\u2009mg daily (p=0.030), 28.6% during 1\u2009mg two times a day (p=0.002) and 3.3% during placebo. The respective frequencies for increased heart rate were 5.1% (p=0.337), 18.5% (p=0.018) and 1.7%. No significant differences between the treatments were seen for other adverse events. Levosimendan did not achieve the primary endpoint of improving sitting SVC in ALS. Headache and increased heart rate were increased on levosimendan, although it was otherwise well tolerated.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

We conducted the current study to analyze the clinical, immunologic, and neurophysiologic features of primary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome (pSS)-associated sensory small fiber neuropathies (SFNs). Forty consecutive pSS patients with SFN were included. SFN was defined by the presence of suggestive sensory painful symptoms with normal nerve conduction studies and abnormal neurophysiologic tests for small nerve fibers or a low intraepidermal nerve fiber density at skin biopsy. Included patients were compared to 100 pSS patients without peripheral neuropathy.SFN patients were mainly female (92.5%). Age at pSS diagnosis was 55.3 \u00b1 13.1 years, and at SFN diagnosis, 58.9 \u00b1 11.8 years, with a median time to SFN diagnosis after symptom onset of 3.4 years. Clinical symptoms included burning pains (90%), numbness (87.5%), tingling (82.5%), pins and needles (72.5%), electric discharges (70%), and allodynia (55%). Dysautonomia included vasomotor symptoms (66%) and hyperhidrosis (47%). Abnormal neurophysiologic tests included laser evoked potentials (97.5%), thermal quantitative sensory testing (67.5%), and sympathetic skin reflex (40%). A skin biopsy revealed low intraepidermal nerve fiber density in 76% of the 17 tested patients.Compared to the 100 pSS patients without peripheral neuropathy, the 40 pSS-SFN patients were older at pSS diagnosis (55.3 \u00b1 13.1 vs. 49.5 \u00b1 14.9 yr; p = 0.03), and more often had xerostomia (97.5% vs. 81%; p = 0.01) and arthralgia (82.5% vs. 65.0%; p = 0.04). Immunologically, they were characterized by a lower prevalence of serum B-cell activation markers, that is, antinuclear antibodies (65% vs. 85%; p = 0.01), anti-SSA (42.5% vs. 71%; p = 0.002), and anti-SSB (17.5% vs. 39%; p = 0.017); rheumatoid factor (32.5% vs. 66%; p = 0.0005); and hypergammaglobulinemia (35% vs. 62%; p = 0.005).In conclusion, we report the main features of SFN in patients with pSS, the first such study to our knowledge. Our results show that patients with pSS-associated SFN are characterized by an older age at pSS diagnosis and a distinctive immunologic profile hallmarked by a lower frequency of serum B-cell activation markers.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"SFN was defined by the presence of suggestive sensory painful symptoms with normal nerve conduction studies and abnormal neurophysiologic tests for small nerve fibers or a low intraepidermal nerve fiber density at skin biopsy.\"]}"}]}

Mantle zone lymphoma (MZL) is a B-cell proliferation regarded as the follicular variant of intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma (ILL). Neoplastic small lymphoid cells proliferate as wide mantles around atrophic centers of benign appearance. The clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical features of four cases of MZL, heralded by cutaneous lesions, are described and correlated with the lymph node pattern. All specimens showed extensive nodules in the reticular dermis invading the subcutaneous tissue. They were mainly composed of a proliferation of small lymphocytes with slightly irregular nuclear contours and clumped chromatin, forming wide mantles around small atrophic germinal centers. Serial biopsy specimens in case 1 revealed evolution of the skin lesions from pseudolymphoma into MZL. Their immunohistochemistry was similar to that of lymph nodes and showed that the neoplastic cells were CD5+, CD20+, CD22+, CD25+, CD74+, Leu-8+, HLA-DR+, IgM+, IgD+ with restriction for the lambda light chain, CD10-, and CD71-, whereas the germinal center cells were polyclonal. In three cases many CD38+, PCA-1+ plasma cells were present both in the grenz zone and in bordering neoplastic nodules. The clinical course was chronic. The only death occurred from unrelated causes; one patient is still alive 17 years after onset. Skin lesions may be the only manifestation of MZL for an extended period. The differentiation between pseudolymphoma and other lymphoma subtypes is based not only on the histologic and cytologic features but also on the architecture, followed by immunohistochemical confirmation.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"BACKGROUND: Mantle zone lymphoma (MZL) is a B-cell proliferation regarded as the follicular variant of intermediate lymphocytic lym\"]}"}]}

To measure common psychiatric conditions after military deployment with blast exposure and test relationships to post-concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) history. Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found. This may partly be due to the more rigorous method of retrospective mTBI diagnosis determination.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

LKB1 kinase is a tumor suppressor that is causally linked to Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. In complex with the pseudokinase STRAD and the scaffolding protein MO25, LKB1 phosphorylates and activates AMPK family kinases, which mediate many cellular processes. The prototypical family member AMPK regulates cell energy metabolism and epithelial apicobasal polarity. This latter event is also dependent on E-cadherin-mediated adherens junctions (AJs) at lateral borders. Strikingly, overexpression of LKB1/STRAD can also trigger establishment of epithelial polarity in the absence of cell-cell or cell-matrix contacts. However, the upstream factors that normally govern LKB1/STRAD function are unknown. Here we show by immunostaining and fluorescence resonance energy transfer that active LKB1/STRAD kinase complex colocalizes with E-cadherin at AJs. LKB1/STRAD localization and AMPK phosphorylation require E-cadherin-dependent maturation of AJs. However, LKB1/STRAD complex kinase activity is E-cadherin independent. These data suggest that in polarized epithelial cells, E-cadherin regulates AMPK phosphorylation by controlling the localization of the LKB1 complex. The LKB1 complex therefore appears to function downstream of E-cadherin in tumor suppression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Anecdotally, it has been reported that individuals with acquired prosopagnosia compensate for their inability to recognize faces by using other person identity cues such as hair, gait or the voice. Are they therefore superior at the use of non-face cues, specifically voices, to person identity? Here, we empirically measure person and object identity recognition in a patient with acquired prosopagnosia and object agnosia. We quantify person identity (face and voice) and object identity (car and horn) recognition for visual, auditory, and bimodal (visual and auditory) stimuli. The patient is unable to recognize faces or cars, consistent with his prosopagnosia and object agnosia, respectively. He is perfectly able to recognize people's voices and car horns and bimodal stimuli. These data show a reverse shift in the typical weighting of visual over auditory information for audiovisual stimuli in a compromised visual recognition system. Moreover, the patient shows selectively superior voice recognition compared to the controls revealing that two different stimulus domains, persons and objects, may not be equally affected by sensory adaptation effects. This also implies that person and object identity recognition are processed in separate pathways. These data demonstrate that an individual with acquired prosopagnosia and object agnosia can compensate for the visual impairment and become quite skilled at using spared aspects of sensory processing. In the case of acquired prosopagnosia it is advantageous to develop a superior use of voices for person identity recognition in everyday life.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The patient is unable to recognize faces or cars, consistent with his prosopagnosia and object agnosia, respectively.\", \"Anecdotally, it has been reported that individuals with acquired prosopagnosia compensate for their inability to recognize faces by using other person identity cues such as hair, gait or the voice.\"]}"}]}

In adult-type diffuse gliomas, histologic classification has a particularly important effect on clinical care. In 2021, the World Health Organization published the fifth edition of the Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System. This classification incorporates advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of brain tumors with histopathology in order to group tumors into more biologically and molecularly defined entities. As such, tumor classification is significantly improved through better characterized natural histories. These changes have particularly important implications for gliomas. For the first time, adult- and pediatric-type gliomas are classified separately on the basis of differences in molecular pathogenesis and prognosis. Furthermore, the previous broad category of adult-type diffuse gliomas has been consolidated into 3 types: astrocytoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant; oligodendroglioma, IDH mutant and 1p/19q codeleted; and glioblastoma, IDH wild type. These major changes are driven by IDH mutation status and include the restriction of the diagnosis of glioblastoma to tumors that are IDH wild type; the reclassification of tumors previously diagnosed as IDH-mutated glioblastomas as astrocytomas IDH mutated, grade 4; and the requirement for the presence of IDH mutations to classify tumors as astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas. The 2021 World Health Organization central nervous system tumor classification is a major advance toward improving the diagnosis of brain tumors. It will provide clinicians with more accurate guidance on prognosis and optimal therapy for patients and ensure that more homogenous patient populations are enrolled in clinical trials, potentially facilitating the development of more effective therapies.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"thogenesis and prognosis.

Glofitamab, a novel CD20xCD3, T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody, exhibited single-agent activity in Study NP30179, a first-in-human, phase 1 trial in relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Preclinical studies showed that glofitamab leads to T-cell activation, proliferation, and tumor cell killing upon binding to CD20 on malignant cells. Here, we provide evidence of glofitamab's clinical activity, including pharmacodynamic profile, mode of action, and factors associated with clinical response, by evaluating biomarkers in patient samples from the dose-escalation part of this trial. Patients enrolled in Study NP30179 received single-dose obinutuzumab pretreatment (1000 mg) 7\u00a0days before IV glofitamab (5 \u00b5g-25 mg). Glofitamab treatment lasted \u226412 cycles once every 2 or 3 weeks. Blood samples were collected at predefined time points per the clinical protocol; T-cell populations were evaluated centrally by flow cytometry, and cytokine profiles were analyzed. Immunohistochemical and genomic biomarker analyses were performed on tumor biopsy samples. Pharmacodynamic modulation was observed with glofitamab treatment, including dose-dependent induction of cytokines, and T-cell margination, proliferation, and activation in peripheral blood. Gene expression analysis of pretreatment tumor biopsy samples indicated that tumor cell intrinsic factors such as TP53 signaling are associated with resistance to glofitamab, but they may also be interlinked with a diminished effector T-cell profile in resistant tumors and thus represent a poor prognostic factor per se. This integrative biomarker data analysis provides clinical evidence regarding glofitamab's mode of action, supports optimal biological dose selection, and will further guide clinical development.

Having reliable predictive models of prognosis/the risk of infection in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients would allow this problem to be addressed on an individual basis to study and implement possible preventive or therapeutic interventions. To identify and analyze all predictive models of prognosis/the risk of infection in patients with SLE that exist in medical literature. A structured search in PubMed, Embase, and LILACS databases was carried out until May 9, 2020. In addition, a search for abstracts in the American Congress of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) annual meetings' archives published over the past eight years was also conducted. Studies on developing, validating or updating predictive prognostic models carried out in patients with SLE, in which the outcome to be predicted is some type of infection, that were generated in any clinical context and with any time horizon were included. There were no restrictions on language, date, or status of the publication. To carry out the systematic review, the CHARMS (Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies) guideline recommendations were followed. The PROBAST tool (A Tool to Assess the Risk of Bias and Applicability of Prediction Model Studies) was used to assess the risk of bias and the applicability of each model. We identified four models of infection prognosis in patients with SLE. Mostly, there were very few events per candidate predictor. In addition, to construct the models, an initial selection was made based on univariate analyses with no contraction of the estimated coefficients being carried out. This suggests that the proposed models have a high probability of overfitting and being optimistic. To date, very few prognostic models have been published on the infection of SLE patients. These models are very heterogeneous and are rated as having a high risk of bias and methodological weaknesses. Despite the widespread recognition of the frequency and severity of infections in SLE patients, there is no reliable predictive prognostic model that facilitates the study and implementation of personalized preventive or therapeutic measures.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"te, or status of the publication.

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The extent of liver fibrosis predicts long-term outcomes, and hence impacts management and therapy. We developed a non-invasive algorithm to stage fibrosis using non-parametric, machine learning methods designed for predictive modeling, and incorporated an invariant genetic marker of liver fibrosis risk. Of 4277 patients with chronic liver disease, 1992 with chronic hepatitis C (derivation cohort) were analyzed to develop the model, and subsequently validated in an independent cohort of 1242 patients. The model was assessed in cohorts with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) (n=555) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (n=488). Model performance was compared to FIB-4 and APRI, and also to the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) and Forns' index, in those with NAFLD. Significant fibrosis (\u2a7eF2) was similar in the derivation (48.4%) and validation (47.4%) cohorts. The FibroGENE-DT yielded the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) of 0.87, 0.85 and 0.804 for the prediction of fast fibrosis progression, cirrhosis and significant fibrosis risk, respectively, with comparable results in the validation cohort. The model performed well in NAFLD and CHB with AUROCs of 0.791, and 0.726, respectively. The negative predictive value to exclude cirrhosis was>0.96 in all three liver diseases.

Trophinin-associated protein (TROAP) is a cytoplasmic protein required for microtubular cytoskeleton regulation and spindle assembly, and its expression plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of various types of cancer. However, little is known about the role of TROAP in breast cancer (BC). TROAP mRNA expression levels and clinical data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets (GSE42568, 104 BC patients; GSE1456, 159 BC patients; and GSE21653, 266 BC patients) were analyzed by the R2: Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform to estimate overall survival (OS). We also analyzed the genes correlated with TROAP by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis to predict potential relationships between TROAP and other genes in BC. Our study verified that both TROAP mRNA and protein expression levels were upregulated in human BC samples and cell lines. In vitro experiments demonstrated that TROAP knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation, the G1 to S phase transition, and the migration and invasion abilities of BC cells. The present study suggests that TROAP plays an important role in promoting the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of BC.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Trophinin-associated protein (TROAP) is a cytoplasmic protein required for microtubular cytoskeleton regulation and spindle assembly, and its expression plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of various types of cancer.\"]}"}]}

Introduction Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) or Wilkie's syndrome is a rare condition arising due to compression of the third part of the duodenum between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery.\u00a0It is important to explore factors which help in suspicion and early diagnosis of the condition. The aim of this study was to find out if measurements of aortomesenteric angle and distance can predict the occurrence of SMA syndrome. Another objective was to find out if the BMI was correlated with the aortomesenteric angle and distance of the patients. Methods A retrospective hospital-based case-control study was conducted in Qimat Rai Gupta Central hospital, Haryana, India from 2018-2020. Out of total 2100 records of acute and chronic abdominal pain patients, only seven cases of Wilkie's syndrome were confirmed via Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT). Information on age, gender, BMI, duration of symptoms, clinical presentation, aortomesenteric angle, and distance was compared among three groups: Group I-SMA syndrome patients (N=7), Group II- acute abdominal pain patients (N=14) and Group III- chronic abdominal pain patients (N=14). Results The hospital prevalence of Wilkie's was found to be 0.3%.\u00a0The median age of patients in Group I corresponded to 26 years as opposed to Group II (31.5years) and Group III (30.5 years). There was a statistically significant reduction in the aortomesenteric angle and distance of Group I patients (22\u00ba, 6mm) as compared to both Group II (52.5\u00ba, 11mm) and Group III patients (52\u00ba, 11mm). A moderate correlation of BMI was found with aortomesenteric angle (r=0.479) and distance (r=0.357). Conclusions There was a significant reduction in the aortomesenteric angle and distance of the SMA patients as compared to both patients having acute and chronic abdominal pain. The BMI of patients was positively correlated to aortomesenteric angle and distance to the moderate level. Thus BMI along with aortomesenteric angle and distance can predict the presence of SMA syndrome.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Introduction Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) or Wilkie's syndrome is a rare condition arising due to compression of the third part of the duodenum between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery.\\u00c2\\u00a0\"]}"}]}

Severe anemia and iron deficiency are common complications in chronic kidney disease. The cause of renal anemia is multifactorial and includes decreased erythropoietin (Epo) production, iron deficiency, and inflammation, and it is currently treated with injections of synthetic Epo. However, the use of recombinant Epo has several adverse effects. We previously reported that high fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels in mice are associated with decreased red blood cell production, whereas genetic inactivation of Fgf23 results in expansion of the erythroid lineage. The present study is the first to show that high FGF23 levels in a mouse model of renal failure contribute to renal anemia, and inhibiting FGF23 signaling stimulates erythropoiesis and abolishes anemia and iron deficiency. Moreover, we show that inhibition of FGF23 signaling significantly decreases erythroid cell apoptosis and influences the commitment of hematopoietic stem cells toward the erythroid linage. Furthermore, we show that blocking FGF23 signaling attenuates inflammation, resulting in increased serum iron and ferritin levels. Our data clearly demonstrate that elevated FGF23 is a causative factor in the development of renal anemia and iron deficiency, and importantly, blocking FGF23 signaling represents a novel approach to stimulate erythropoiesis and possibly improve survival for millions of chronic kidney disease patients worldwide.-Agoro, R., Montagna, A., Goetz, R., Aligbe, O., Singh, G., Coe, L.

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

BI 1015550 is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor that has antifibrotic properties. Phase I and Ic studies were conducted to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BI 1015550 in healthy male subjects and patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In the phase I study, 42 subjects were partially randomised to receive placebo or BI 1015550 in single rising doses of 36\u2005mg and 48\u2005mg, or multiple rising doses of 6\u2005mg and 12\u2005mg twice daily over 14\u2005days. In the phase Ic study, 15 patients with IPF were randomised to receive 18\u2005mg BI 1015550 or placebo twice daily for up to 12\u2005weeks. For both studies, the primary endpoint was the number of subjects with drug-related adverse events (AEs). In the Phase I study, drug-related AEs were reported for 50.0% of healthy male subjects treated with a single dose of BI 1015550, compared with 16.7% receiving placebo. For those receiving multiple doses, drug-related AEs were reported for 37.5% of those treated with BI 1015550 and 12.5% receiving placebo. The most frequently reported AEs by organ class were nervous system disorders, which were largely driven by headache. In the Phase Ic study, drug-related AEs were reported in 90.0% of patients treated with BI 1015550, compared with 60.0% of those receiving placebo. The most frequent AEs by organ class were gastrointestinal AEs.

Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are heterobifunctional molecules consisting of one ligand that binds to a protein of interest (POI) and another that can recruit an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The chemically-induced proximity between the POI and E3 ligase results in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the POI by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The event-driven mechanism of action (MOA) of PROTACs offers several advantages compared to traditional occupancy-driven small molecule inhibitors, such as a catalytic nature, reduced dosing and dosing frequency, a more potent and longer-lasting effect, an added layer of selectivity to reduce potential toxicity, efficacy in the face of drug-resistance mechanisms, targeting nonenzymatic functions, and expanded target space.

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), such as thalidomide and its derivatives lenalidomide and pomalidomide, are key treatment modalities for hematologic malignancies, particularly multiple myeloma (MM) and del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the CRL4 ubiquitin ligase complex, is the primary target by which IMiDs mediate anticancer and teratogenic effects. Here we identify a ubiquitin-independent physiological chaperone-like function of CRBN that promotes maturation of the basigin (BSG; also known as CD147) and solute carrier family 16 member 1 (SLC16A1; also known as MCT1) proteins. This process allows for the formation and activation of the CD147-MCT1 transmembrane complex, which promotes various biological functions, including angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion and lactate export. We found that IMiDs outcompete CRBN for binding to CD147 and MCT1, leading to destabilization of the CD147-MCT1 complex. Accordingly, IMiD-sensitive MM cells lose CD147 and MCT1 expression after being exposed to IMiDs, whereas IMiD-resistant cells retain their expression. Furthermore, del(5q) MDS cells have elevated CD147 expression, which is attenuated after IMiD treatment. Finally, we show that BSG (CD147) knockdown phenocopies the teratogenic effects of thalidomide exposure in zebrafish. These findings provide a common mechanistic framework to explain both the teratogenic and pleiotropic antitumor effects of IMiDs.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the CRL4 ubiquitin ligase complex, is the primary target by which IMiDs mediate anticancer and teratogenic effects.\"]}"}]}

Brainstem gliomas (BSGs) are uncommon in adults accounting for about 2% of all intracranial neoplasms. They are often phenotypically low-grade as compared to their more common paediatric counterparts. Since brainstem biopsies are rarely performed, these tumours are commonly classified according to their MR imaging characteristics into 4 subgroups: (a) diffuse intrinsic low-grade gliomas, (b) enhancing malignant gliomas, (c) focal tectal gliomas and (d) exophytic gliomas/other subtypes. The prognosis and treatment is variable for the different types and is almost similar to adult supratentorial gliomas. Radiotherapy (RT) with adjuvant chemotherapy is the standard treatment of diffuse low-grade and malignant BSGs, whereas, surgical resection is limited to the exophytic subtypes. Review of previous literature shows that the detailed imaging of adult BSGs has not received significant attention. This review illustrates in detail the imaging features of adult BSGs using conventional and advanced MR techniques like diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), MR perfusion weighted imaging (PWI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), as well as 18F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine positron emission tomography (18F-FET/PET).

Cross-sectional. Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms. While some researchers have implicated mTBI history as a contributor to post-deployment mental health conditions, no clear association was found.

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes.

Transcription factors (TFs) represent a major class of therapeutic targets for the treatment of human diseases including cancer. Although the biological functions and even crystal structures of many TFs have been clearly elucidated, there is still no viable approach to target the majority of TFs, thus rendering them undruggable for decades. PROTACs (proteolysis targeting chimeras) emerge as a powerful class of therapeutic modalities, which rely on induced protein-protein interactions between the proteins of interest (POIs) and E3 ubiquitin ligases to aid the degradation of POIs by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Here, we report the development of a platform termed TF-PROTAC, which links an DNA oligonucleotide to an E3 ligase ligand via a click reaction, to selectively degrade the TF of interest. The selectivity of these TF-PROTACs depends on the DNA oligonucleotides utilized that can be specific to the TFs of interest. We have developed two series of VHL-based TF-PROTACs, NF-\u03baB-PROTAC (dNF-\u03baB) and E2F-PROTAC (dE2F), which effectively degrade endogenous p65 and E2F1 proteins in cells, respectively, and subsequently display superior antiproliferative effects in cells. Collectively, our results suggest that TF-PROTACs provide a generalizable platform to achieve selective degradation of TFs and a universal strategy for targeting most \"undruggable\" TFs.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"PROTACs (proteolysis targeting chimeras) emerge as a powerful class of therapeutic modalities, which rely on induced protein-protein interactions between the proteins of interest (POIs) and E3 ubiquitin ligases to aid the degradation of POIs by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS).\"]}"}]}

This study, therefore, applied Machine Learning Methods for predicting infant mortality in Rwanda.\u00a0 METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was conducted using the 2014-15 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey. Python software version 3.8 was employed to test and apply ML methods through Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic regression. STATA version 13 was used for analysing conventional methods. Evaluation metrics methods specifically confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Area under the\u00a0Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) were used to evaluate the performance of predictive models. Ability of prediction was between 68.6% and 61.5% for AML. We preferred with the RF model (61.5%) presenting the best performance. The RF model was the best predictive model of IM with accuracy (84.3%), recall (91.3%), precision (80.3%), F1 score (85.5%), and AUROC (84.2%); followed by decision tree model with model accuracy (83%), recall (91%), precision (79%), F1 score (84.67%) and AUROC(82.9%), followed by support vector machine with model accuracy (68.6%), recall (74.9%), precision(67%), F1 score (70.73%) and AUROC (68.6%) and last was a logistic regression with the low accuracy of prediction (61.5%), recall (61.1%), precision (62.2%), F1 score (61.6%) and AUROC (61.5%) compared to other predictive models.

This study compared the efficacy of pegfilgrastim primary prophylaxis (PPP) with CP neutropaenia management in breast cancer. Individual patient data (N=2282) from 11 clinical trials and observational studies using chemotherapy regimens with > or =15% FN risk and PPP (6 mg, all cycles) or CP (no G-CSF or any cycle G-CSF/pegfilgrastim) were included in an integrated analysis. Most patients received docetaxel-containing regimens. A generalised linear mixed model was fitted (N=2210). Neutropaenia prophylaxis (PPP versus CP), age and disease stage influenced the incidence of FN. Overall, FN was less frequent with PPP than with CP (odds ratio [OR]: 0.124; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08, 0.194; P<0.0001). Odds for cycle 1 FN, dose reductions > or =15% and FN-related hospitalisation were also significantly lower with PPP.

This review aimed to categorize thoracic endometriosis syndrome (TES) according to whether the presenting symptoms were catamenial and to evaluate whether such a categorization enables a better management strategy. An electronic search was conducted using the PubMed/Medline database. The following keywords were used in combination with the Boolean operators AND OR: \"thoracic endometriosis syndrome,\" \"thoracic endometriosis,\" \"diaphragm endometriosis,\" and \"catamenial pneumothorax.\" The initial search yielded 445 articles. Articles in non-English languages, those whose full texts were unavailable, and those that did not present the symptomatology clearly were further excluded. After these exclusions, the review included 240 articles and 480 patients: 61 patients in the noncatamenial group and 419 patients in the catamenial group. The groups differed significantly in presenting symptoms, surgical treatment techniques, and observed localization of endometriotic loci (p <.05). This review points out the significant differences between patients with TES with catamenial and noncatamenial symptoms. Such categorization and awareness by clinicians of these differences among patients with TES can be helpful in designing a management strategy. When constructing management guidelines, these differences between patients with catamenial and noncatamenial symptoms should be taken into consideration.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to categorize thoracic endometriosis syndrome (TES) according to whether the presenting symptoms were catamenial and to evaluate whether such a categorization enables a better management strategy.\"]}"}]}

Telemedicine applications are increasingly being introduced in patient care in various disciplines, including clinical genetics, mainly to increase access to care and to reduce time and costs for patients and professionals. Most telegenetics reports describe applications in large geographical areas, showing positive patients' and professionals' satisfaction. One economic analysis published thus far reported lower costs than in-person care. We hypothesized that telegenetics can also be beneficial from the professional's view in relatively small geographical areas. We performed a pilot study in the Northern Netherlands of 51 home-based online counseling sessions for cardiogenetic and oncogenetic cascade screening, and urgent prenatal counseling. Previously, we showed patient satisfaction, anxiety, and perceived control of online counseling to be comparable to in-person counseling. This study focuses on expectations, satisfaction, and practical evaluations of the involved counselors, and the impact in terms of time and costs. Most counselors expected disadvantages of online counseling for themselves and their patients, mainly concerning insufficient non-verbal communication; few expected advantages for themselves. Afterwards, counselors additionally raised the disadvantage of insufficient verbal communication, and reported frequent technical problems. Their overall mean telemedicine satisfaction itemscore was 3.38 before, and 2.95 afterwards, being afterwards slightly below the minimum level we set for a satisfactory result. We estimated reduced time and costs by online counseling with about 8% and 10-12%, respectively. We showed online genetic counseling to be effective, feasible and cost-efficient, but technical improvements are needed to increase counselors' satisfaction.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"We estimated reduced time and costs by online counseling with about 8% and 10-12%, respectively.\"]}"}]}

High-resolution NMR spectroscopy of (1)H spins in the solid state is normally rendered difficult due to the strong homonuclear (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings. Even under very high-speed magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ca. 60-70kHz, these couplings are not completely removed. An appropriate radiofrequency pulse scheme is required to average out the homonuclear dipolar interactions in combination with MAS to get high-resolution (1)H NMR spectrum in solid state. Several schemes have been introduced in the recent past with a variety of applications also envisaged. Development of some of these schemes has been made possible with a clear understanding of the underlying spin physics based on bimodal Floquet theory. The utility of these high-resolution pulse schemes in combination with MAS has been demonstrated for spinning speeds of 10-65kHz in a range of (1)H Larmor frequencies from 300 to 800MHz.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9).

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a risk factor for end-stage renal failure and cardiovascular events. In patients with CKD, anemia is often caused by decreased erythropoietin production relative to hemoglobin levels. As correction of anemia is associated with improved cardiac and renal function and quality of life, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are standard therapy for anemia in CKD patients. However, traditional ESAs such as epoetin or darbepoetin have short half-lives and require frequent administration, dose changes, and close monitoring of hemoglobin concentration to maintain target hemoglobin levels. Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (MPG-EPO) is the only ESA that is generated by chemical modification of glycosylated erythropoietin through the integration of one specific, long, linear chain of polyethylene glycol. This ESA induces continuous erythropoietin receptor activation and has a long half-life (approximately 130 hours). Subcutaneous or intravenous administration of MPG-EPO once every 2 weeks or monthly achieved a high hemoglobin response rate in patients with anemia associated with CKD, regardless of whether the patient was undergoing dialysis. According to data from an observational time and motion study, MPG-EPO maintains hemoglobin levels when the same dose is administered, however infrequently. This suggests that compared with the use of traditional ESAs, administration of MPG-EPO reduces the overall time and cost associated with the management of anemia in CKD patients undergoing dialysis. MPG-EPO is generally well tolerated and most adverse events are of mild to moderate severity. The most commonly reported adverse effects are hypertension, nasopharyngitis, and diarrhea. Subcutaneous injection of MPG-EPO is significantly less painful than subcutaneous injection of darbepoetin.

Human CRBN (cereblon) gene is located on chromosome 3 at 3p26 and its encoding protein is a member of E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (composed of CRBN, DDB1, CUL4A and ROC1). The E3 ubiquitin ligase complex functions in the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation pathway and attaches polyubiquitin chains to substrate proteins for degradation via the protease complex. Currently, there are no standardized assays for CRBN gene and protein measurement although quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry and Western blot are widely used. CRBN has been identified as a direct target for immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD) and plays a significant role in anti-proliferation, pro-apoptotic effects, anti-angiogenic activities, immunomodulatory activities and intervention of cell surface adhesion molecules between myeloma cells and bone marrow stromal cells. Recently, clinical data show that majority of the multiple myeloma patients treated with IMiD develop drug-resistance over time by unknown mechanisms. Fortunately, various in vivo and in vitro studies have revealed that the decreased CRBN expression or CRBN deletion is associated with resistance to IMiD in treating multiple myeloma, and CRBN expression levels may have a prognostic significance. Furthermore, the most recently discovered protein IKZF1, IKZF3, IRF4, C/EBP\u03b2 and Wnt/catenin signaling pathways may also be closely related to IMiD resistance in myeloma.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"CRBN has been identified as a direct target for immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD) and plays a significant role in anti-proliferation, pro-apoptotic effects, anti-angiogenic activities, immunomodulatory activities and intervention of cell surface adhesion molecules between myeloma cells and bone marrow stromal cells.\"]}"}]}

Small fibre neuropathy (SFN), a condition dominated by neuropathic pain, is frequently encountered in clinical practise either as prevalent manifestation of more diffuse neuropathy or distinct nosologic entity. Aetiology of SFN includes pre-diabetes status and immune-mediated diseases, though it remains frequently unknown. Due to their physiologic characteristics, small nerve fibres cannot be investigated by routine electrophysiological tests, making the diagnosis particularly difficult. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) to assess the psychophysical thresholds for cold and warm sensations and skin biopsy with quantification of somatic intraepidermal nerve fibres (IENF) have been used to determine the damage to small nerve fibres. Nevertheless, the diagnostic criteria for SFN have not been defined yet and a 'gold standard' for clinical practise and research is not available. We screened 486 patients referred to our institutions and collected 124 patients with sensory neuropathy. Among them, we identified 67 patients with pure SFN using a new diagnostic 'gold standard', based on the presence of at least two abnormal results at clinical, QST and skin biopsy examination. The diagnosis of SFN was achieved by abnormal clinical and skin biopsy findings in 43.3% of patients, abnormal skin biopsy and QST findings in 37.3% of patients, abnormal clinical and QST findings in 11.9% of patients, whereas 7.5% patients had abnormal results at all the examinations. Skin biopsy showed a diagnostic efficiency of 88.4%, clinical examination of 54.6% and QST of 46.9%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis confirmed the significantly higher performance of skin biopsy comparing with QST. However, we found a significant inverse correlation between IENF density and both cold and warm thresholds at the leg. Clinical examination revealed pinprick and thermal hypoesthesia in about 50% patients, and signs of peripheral vascular autonomic dysfunction in about 70% of patients. Spontaneous pain dominated the clinical picture in most SFN patients. Neuropathic pain intensity was more severe in patients with SFN than in patients with large or mixed fibre neuropathy, but there was no significant correlation with IENF density. The aetiology of SFN was initially unknown in 41.8% of patients and at 2-year follow-up a potential cause could be determined in 25% of them. Over the same period, 13% of SFN patients showed the involvement of large nerve fibres, whereas in 45.6% of them the clinical picture did not change. Spontaneous remission of neuropathic pain occurred in 10.9% of SFN patients, while it worsened in 30.4% of them.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Small fibre neuropathy (SFN), a condition dominated by neuropathic pain, is frequently encountered in clinical practise either as prevalent manifestation of more diffuse neuropathy or distinct nosologic entity.\"]}"}]}

Astrocytic tumors are primary central nervous system tumors. They are the most common tumors arising from glial cells. In the new WHO classification 2021, adult-type diffuse astrocytic gliomas subdivide into isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant astrocytoma, IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendroglioma, and IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch sign describes the MRI appearance of IDH-mutant astrocytoma, it is considered a highly specific radiogenomic signature for diffuse astrocytoma, as opposed to other lower-grade. MRI is the first and most accurate diagnostic tool for low-grade gliomas (LGGs). It is particularly helpful in distinguishing a diffuse astrocytoma from an oligodendroglioma that will not demonstrate T2-FLAIR mismatch. The tumor displays a hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images and a hypointense signal on T2-weighted FLAIR images, which distinguishes it from other types of diffuse gliomas. We report a case of a 29-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with IDH-mutant 1p/19q-non-codeleted diffuse astrocytoma based on MRI T-2 FLAIR mismatch sign, which is confirmed by the molecular analysis in the pathology lab.

Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is the latest and perhaps most significant innovation in surgery since Phillipe Mouret of France performed the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1987. This new \"minimum-invasive\" concept that promises scar-free surgery is steadily gathering momentum. It is another milestone in our quest to eliminate surgical trauma, speed patient recovery time and decrease surgical wound-related complications. On 22 July 2005, the Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research (NOSCAR) published a white paper highlighting the barriers to NOTES development, which included the need for appropriate selection of access points, effective closure of the enterotomy site, innovative tools, stable platforms and improved endoscopic orientation. These are just some of the many issues that need to be resolved before the NOTES concept and technique could become a common feature of modern surgery. The publication of the white paper ushered in the beginning of multiple research projects using animal models to test the application of NOTES and its newly developed instruments. The success in animal models was followed by several highly selected successful human trials. National and international surgical innovation departments should now be created where medical industry personnel including inventors, designers and engineers can work together with the medical and surgical providers to address all the limitations affecting NOTES progress.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Anemia is a common complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), mainly due to inadequate renal production of erythropoietin. In hemodialysis (HD) patients this condition may be aggravated by iron deficiency (absolute or functional). The correction of this anemia is usually achieved by treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron (oral or intravenous). Studies questioning the safety of ESAs (especially at higher doses) changed the pattern of anemia treatment in CKD patients. According to the new guidelines, when transferrin saturation is lower than 30% and ferritin lower than 500 ng/mL, a trial with iron should be started, to avoid therapy with ESAs or at least to reduce the doses needed to treat the anemia. Recent reports showed increasing ferritin levels, towards values above 800 ng/mL, in CKD patients treated according to the guidelines.

Nivolumab (Opdivo, Bristol Meyer Squibb, New York, NY) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda, Merck, Kenilworth, NJ) are the first two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibodies targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1). Nivolumab and pembrolizumab work by interfering with the interaction between PD-1 and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), whose unimpeded interaction downregulates T cells allowing cancer cells to evade immune surveillance. These drugs have earned a series of FDA approvals for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), urothelial cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and renal cell cancer. In this review we will summarize the data for efficacy and toxicity for these two agents. We conclude that they represent two valuable but interchangeable alternatives to target their approved indications. We will discuss how this can help global payers seeking to contain the cost of cancer therapeutics that continues to spiral out of control.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Nivolumab (Opdivo, Bristol Meyer Squibb, New York, NY) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda, Merck, Kenilworth, NJ) are the first two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibodies targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1).\"]}"}]}

The present detailed study aimed to establish for the first time the ovarian and uterine hemodynamic change in dairy cows after the end of the puerperal period to investigate a possible association between Doppler indices and volume of blood flow. Twenty cows weighing 500-600\u202fkg (mean 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fkg) and 4-5 years of age (mean 3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 years) categorized into two main groups (true anestrum, with corpus luteum, n\u202f=\u202f10) and (normal cyclic, n\u202f=\u202f10), The period of examination started from day 39 till day 70 after calving with day after day routinely examination by b-mode and Doppler performed on both ovaries with ovarian arteries (OA) and uterus with uterine arteries (MUA) in the ipsilateral (ipsi) and contralateral (contra) side to ovulation, in addition to a thickness in horns and body was measured. Estradiol and progesterone were also measured. Results showed that both Doppler indices in the OA and MUA ipsi and contra had a positive (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) correlation with contra Doppler indices, but revealed a negative (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) correlation with ipsi and contra Doppler velocities, blood flow rate and volume in anestrum cows. Both ovarian and uterine ipsi indices showed an increase (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the anestrum cows, and both PSV and EDV of both arteries ipsilateral showed (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) a decrease in the anestrum cows, the ipsi and contra ovarian and uterine colored % were lower in anestrum group than the normal group. Estradiol (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) decreased in anestrum cows than the normal, while progesterone increased in the anestrum group. Conclusion, although uterine and ovarian morphology were changed in anestrum cows, the vascular system of the ovary as well as uterus underwent much more marked vascular changes, the most significant being that of blood flow velocities and volume.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

Taxifolin has been widely used in the treatment of cerebral infarction and sequelae, cerebral thrombus, coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. A reliable sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for the pharmacokinetic study of taxifolin in rabbit plasma after enzymatic hydrolysis was developed and validated for the first time. Taxifolin, with biochanin A as the internal standard, was extracted from plasma samples by liquid/liquid extraction after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm particle size) and pre-column (2.0 mm, the same sorbent). Two-step linear gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.03% water solution of trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used. The UV detector is set at 290 nm. The elution time for taxifolin and biochanin A was approximately 7.9 and 18.3 min, respectively. The calibration curve of taxifolin was linear (r > 0.9997) over the range of 0.03-5.0 microg/ml in rabbit plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for taxifolin were 0.03 and 0.11 microg/ml, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration of lipid solution to rabbits. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin after oral administration of lipid solution was 36%.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the Abbreviated Injury Score of the head region (HAIS) are validated prognostic factors in traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic performance of an alternative predictive model including motor GCS, pupillary reactivity, age, HAIS, and presence of multi-trauma for short-term mortality with a reference predictive model including motor GCS, pupil reaction, and age (IMPACT core model). A secondary analysis of a prospective epidemiological cohort study in Switzerland including patients after severe TBI (HAIS >3) with the outcome death at 14 days was performed. Performance of prediction, accuracy of discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]), calibration, and validity of the two predictive models were investigated. The cohort included 808 patients (median age, 56; interquartile range, 33-71), median GCS at hospital admission 3 (3-14), abnormal pupil reaction 29%, with a death rate of 29.7% at 14 days. The alternative predictive model had a higher accuracy of discrimination to predict death at 14 days than the reference predictive model (AUROC 0.852, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.824-0.880 vs. AUROC 0.826, 95% CI 0.795-0.857; p\u2009<\u20090.0001).

CKD is one of the fastest growing causes of death in the world and in 2040, it is estimated that it will be in the top five causes of death. In order to slow down this process, it is necessary to improve prevention, inhibit development and treat complications including anemia. Anemia is one of the common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is a significant clinical problem. It is most often the result of decreased renal production of erythropoietin and / or iron deficiency. Iron deficiency anemia is one of the most common problems in CKD that increases mortality. In order to successfully treat anemia in CKD with erythropoiesis-stimulating agentsand (ESA) and iron substitution, it is necessary to determine iron iron level. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia in patients with CKD is complicated due to the relatively low predictive ability of routine serum iron markers (e.g., ferritin and transferrin saturation) and more invasive measurements such as bone marrow iron stores. In the review novel biomarkers of iron metabolism are discussed such as hypoxia-inducible factor, erythroferon, growth differentiation factor 15 etc. with their possible clinical relevance.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\" development and treat complications including anemia.

To investigate neutrophil activation in peripheral blood during acute human anaphylaxis. Patients presenting to the emergency department with anaphylaxis underwent blood sampling upon enrolment and at up to three subsequent time-points. Traditional anaphylaxis biomarkers, histamine and mast cell tryptase, were measured by ELISA and ImmunoCAP, respectively. Plasma myeloperoxidase concentrations were measured by ELISA, serum soluble CD62L concentrations by cytometric bead array, and both compared to healthy controls. In 72 patients, 37 (51%) had severe anaphylaxis, 33 (60%) were histamine positive, and 47 (70%) were mast cell tryptase positive. At enrolment, myeloperoxidase concentrations were 2.9- (95% CI: 1.3, 6.5) and 5.0- (95% CI: 2.4, 10.5) fold higher in moderate and severe patients, respectively, compared with healthy controls, and remained stable over the first 5 h following symptom onset.

The prevalence of iron deficiency and its contribution to the anemia of end stage renal disease has been extensively studied, but much less is known about the role of iron deficiency in the pathogenesis of the anemia of chronic kidney disease in predialysis patients. All new hemodialysis patients entering a single hemodialysis unit between July 1999 and April 2002 were included in the study. The admission laboratory tests and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) 2728 form were examined to determine the prevalence of erythropoietin use, anemia (Hb<11 g/dl), and iron deficiency (ferritin<100 ng/ml and transferrin saturation %<20%). In a second part of the study, the effect of intravenous iron gluconate replacement in patients with stage III & IV chronic kidney disease was examined. Anemia was present in 68% of all patients starting hemodialysis. Iron deficiency was a common feature occurring in 29% of patients taking erythropoietin (49% of all patients) and 26% of patients without erythropoietin (51% of all patients). Following the administration of intravenous iron gluconate to four patients, there was a significant rise in hemoglobin levels from 10.6+/-0.19 to 11.7+/-g/dl (p=0.02).

Muscular dystrophies refer to a group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness, wasting and degeneration. So far, there is no effective treatment but new gene-based therapies are currently being developed with particular noted advances in using conventional gene replacement strategies, RNA-based approaches, or cell-based gene therapy with a main focus on Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy and current treatments are far from adequate. However, genetic and cell-based therapies, in particular exon skipping induced by antisense strategies, and corrective gene therapy via functionally engineered dystrophin genes hold great promise, with several clinical trials ongoing. Proof-of-concept of exon skipping has been obtained in animal models, and most recently in clinical trials; this approach represents a promising therapy for a subset of patients. In addition, gene-delivery-based strategies exist both for antisense-induced reading frame restoration, and for highly efficient delivery of functional dystrophin mini- and micro-genes to muscle fibres in vivo and muscle stem cells ex-vivo. In particular, AAV-based vectors show efficient systemic gene delivery to skeletal muscle directly in vivo, and lentivirus-based vectors show promise of combining ex vivo gene modification strategies with cell-mediated therapies.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"So far, there is no effective treatment but new gene-based therapies are currently being developed with particular noted advances in using conventional gene replacement strategies, RNA-based approaches, or cell-based gene therapy with a main focus on Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).\"]}"}]}

Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitylation, need to be tightly controlled to guarantee the accurate localization and activity of proteins. Ubiquitylation is a dynamic process primarily responsible for proteasome-mediated degradation of substrate proteins and crucial for both normal homeostasis and disease. Alterations in ubiquitylation lead to the upregulation of oncoproteins and/or downregulation of tumor suppressors, thus concurring in tumorigenesis. PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) is an innovative strategy that takes advantage by the cell's own Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS). Each PROTAC molecule is composed by a ligand that recruits the target protein of interest (POI), a ligand specific for an E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme, and a linker that connects these units. Upon binding to the POI, the PROTAC recruits the E3 inducing ubiquitylation-dependent proteasome degradation of the POI. To date, PROTAC technology has entered in clinical trials for several human cancers. Here, we will discuss the advantages and limitations of PROTACs development and safety considerations for their clinical application. Furthermore, we will review the potential of PROTAC strategy as therapeutic option in brain tumor, focusing on glioblastoma.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) is an innovative strategy that takes advantage by the cell's own Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS).\"]}"}]}

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation testing has several limitations. Therefore, we built predictive models to determine the EGFR mutation status of patients and guide therapeutic decision-making. We collected data from 320 patients with lung carcinoma, including sex, age, smoking history, serum tumour marker levels, maximum standardized uptake value, pathological results, computed tomography images, and EGFR mutation status. Artificial neural network (ANN) models based on multiple clinical characteristics were proposed to predict EGFR mutation status. A training set (n\u2009=\u2009200) was used to develop predictive models of the EGFR mutation status (Model 1: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]\u2009=\u20090.910, 95% CI 0.861-0.945; Model 2: AUROC\u2009=\u20090.859, 95% CI 0.803-0.904; Model 3: AUROC\u2009=\u20090.711, 95% CI 0.643-0.773).

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a frequent complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with adverse outcomes in these patients. Patients with CKD and IDA remain largely undertreated. Conventional oral iron agents are insufficiently effective due to poor absorption and cause gastrointestinal side effects; thus, novel oral iron preparations are needed. This article covers current treatment guidelines for patients with anemia and CKD and clinical trial data for iron-repletion agents currently in use, as well as for novel oral iron therapies in development. Ferric citrate, a novel oral iron-repletion agent approved for patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD and IDA, demonstrated improvements in hemoglobin levels and iron parameters, with good tolerability in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD. When used as a phosphate binder, ferric citrate also improves hemoglobin and iron parameters in dialysis-dependent CKD, but additional trials are needed to evaluate its efficacy as an iron-repletion agent in this setting. Other novel oral iron preparations in development for IDA in patients with CKD include ferric maltol, which is approved in Europe and the United States for IDA in adult patients, and sucrosomial iron, which has been evaluated in IDA associated with CKD and several other clinical settings.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a frequent complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with adverse outcomes in these patients.\"]}"}]}

We have developed a heterobifunctional all-small molecule PROTAC (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera) capable of inducing proteasomal degradation of the androgen receptor. This cell permeable PROTAC consists of a non-steroidal androgen receptor ligand (SARM) and the MDM2 ligand known as nutlin, connected by a PEG-based linker. The SARM-nutlin PROTAC recruits the androgen receptor to MDM2, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This leads to the ubiquitination of the androgen receptor, and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Upon treatment of HeLa cells with 10microM PROTAC for 7h, we were able to observe a decrease in androgen receptor levels. This degradation is proteasome dependent, as it is mitigated in cells pre-treated with 10microM epoxomicin, a specific proteasome inhibitor. These results have implications for the potential study and treatment of various cancers with increased androgen receptor levels.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"We have developed a heterobifunctional all-small molecule PROTAC (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera) capable of inducing proteasomal degradation of the androgen receptor.\"]}"}]}

Since morbidity and mortality rates of anaphylaxis diseases have been increasing year by year, how to prevent and manage these diseases effectively has become an important issue. Mast cells play a central regulatory role in allergic diseases. Angiopoietin1 (Ang-1) exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting vascular permeability, leukocyte migration and cytokine production. However, Ang-1's function in mast cell activation and anaphylaxis diseases is unknown. The results of our study suggest that Ang-1 decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines production of mast cells by suppressing I\u03baB phosphorylation and NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation. Ang-1 also strongly inhibited compound 48/80 induced and Fc\u03b5RI-mediated mast cells degranulation by decreasing intracellular calcium levels in vitro. In vivo lentivirus-mediated delivery of Ang-1 in mice exhibited alleviated leakage in IgE-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA). Furthermore, exogenous Ang-1 intervention treatment prevented mice from compound 48/80-induced mesentery mast cell degranulation, attenuated increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, relieved lung injury, and improved survival in anaphylaxis shock. The results of our study reveal, for the first time, the important role of Ang-1 in the activation of mast cells, and identify a therapeutic effect of Ang-1 on anaphylaxis diseases. ```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"r, Ang-1's function in mast cell activation and anaphylaxis diseases is unknown.

Mast cells are phylogenetically old innate immune cells with less recognition in normal function of immune system as no such disease has been observed in humans due to their deficiency or inadequate function. Earlier mast cells were only known for their important role in the type 1 allergic reactions (i.e. anaphylaxis or some contact hypersensitivity reactions) due to release of various biochemical mediators (i.e. cytokines, chemokines, lipid mediators, proteases and biologic amines). Several studies indicated that they do not only come in action upon binding of IgE to its corresponding receptors expressed by them but also play an important role in host immunity. Recent development in understanding the mast cell biology has established various important roles of these cells in regulating both innate as well as adaptive immune response under normal or pathophysiological conditions (i.e. acute or chronic bacterial or parasitic infections, various autoimmune disease, pregnancy, etc.). Present review is designed to accommodate up to date information regarding mast cell development (i.e. factors governing mast cell development and their homing to various compartments (i.e. skin, lungs, intestine, uterus, etc.) along with their role in innate immunity, human pregnancy and future immunomodulatory approach comprising of targeting mast cells.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Earlier mast cells were only known for their important role in the type 1 allergic reactions (i.e. anaphylaxis or some contact hypersensitivity reactions) \"]}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes.

Many children recovering from anesthesia experience pain that is severe enough to warrant intravenous (IV) opioid treatment within moments of admission to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Postoperative pain has several negative consequences; therefore, preventing significant PACU pain in children is both a major clinical goal and a moral/ethical imperative. This requires identifying patient-level and perioperative factors that may be used to predict PACU IV opioid requirement. This should allow for the development of personalized care protocols to prevent clinically significant PACU pain in children. Our objective was to develop prediction models enabling practitioners to identify children at risk for PACU IV opioid requirement after various painful ambulatory surgical procedures. After Institutional Review Board approval, clinical, demographic, and anthropometric data were prospectively collected on 1256 children 4-17 years of age scheduled for painful ambulatory surgery (defined as intraoperative administration of analgesia or local anesthetic infiltration). Three multivariable logistic regression models to determine possible predictors of PACU IV opioid requirement were constructed based on (1) preoperative history; (2) history + intraoperative variables; and (3) history + intraoperative variables + PACU variables. Candidate predictors were chosen from readily obtainable parameters routinely collected during the surgical visit. Predictive performance of each model was assessed by calculating the area under the respective receiver operating characteristic curves. Overall, 29.5% of patients required a PACU IV opioid, while total PACU analgesia requirement (oral or IV) was 41.1%. Independent predictors using history alone were female sex, decreasing age, surgical history, and non-Caucasian ethnicity (model area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.59 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.55-0.63]). Adding a few intraoperative variables improved the discriminant ability of the model (AUROC for the history + intraoperative variables model, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.67-0.74]). Addition of first-documented PACU pain score produced a substantially improved model (AUROC, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.82-0.87]). Postoperative pain requiring PACU IV opioid in children may be determined using a small set of easily obtainable perioperative variables. Our models require validation in other settings to determine their clinical usefulness.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"ement (oral or IV) was 41.1%.

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the prototype of primary humoral immunodeficiencies. Long-term follow-up studies regarding disease-related complications and outcome are scarce. Our aim was to describe the natural history of XLA. A nationwide multicenter study based on the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry was established in 2000 in Italy. Affected patients were enrolled by documenting centers, and the patients' laboratory, clinical, and imaging data were recorded on an annual base. Data on the patients (N\u00a0= 168) were derived from a cumulative follow-up of 1370 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 8.35 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis decreased after establishment of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry (84 months before vs 23 months after). Respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent clinical symptoms at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Regular immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduced the incidence of invasive infections. Affected patients developed chronic lung disease over time (47% after 40 years of follow-up) in the presence of chronic sinusitis (84%). Malignancies were documented in a minority of cases (3.7%). Overall survival for affected patients was significantly reduced when compared with that for the healthy male Italian population, and it further deteriorated in the presence of chronic lung disease. This is the first detailed long-term follow-up study for patients with XLA, revealing that although immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduces the incidence of invasive infections, it does not appear to influence the development of chronic lung disease. The overall survival of affected patients is reduced. Further studies are warranted to improve patients' clinical management and increase awareness among physicians.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a safe, non-invasive method to collect droplets of the airway surface liquid and measure mediators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) and 8-isoprostane. The aim of our study was to investigate baseline values of inflammatory lipid mediators in EBC and their relation to asthma severity. Nineteen healthy subjects, 16 mild, 12 moderate and 15 severe asthmatics were studied. All subjects attended a clinic visit for spirometry and EBC collection. The concentrations of exhaled cys-LTs and 8-isoprostane were measured by means of specific enzyme immunoassays. 8-isoprostane levels were significantly increased in mild (49.1+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001), moderate (49.7+/-5.2 pg/mL, p<0.001) and severe asthmatics (77.7+/-7.3 pg/mL, p<0.001), compared to healthy controls (16.4+/-1.6 pg/mL). Moreover, 8-isoprostane levels were significantly higher in severe compared to mild and moderate asthmatics (p<0.01). Cys-LT levels were significantly higher in moderate (34.6+/-4.4 pg/mL, p<0.05) and severe asthmatics (47.9+/-6.0 pg/mL, p<0.001), while no significant difference was found between healthy controls and mild asthmatics. 8-isoprostane levels in EBC of asthmatics strongly correlated with cys-LT levels (r=0.61, p<0.0001). 8-isoprostane and cys-LT are detectable in EBC of healthy subjects and their levels progressively increase in asthmatic patients according to disease severity.

These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation.

Using an 81% sensitivity threshold (optimum level from receiver operating characteristic curve, corresponding to 1.2% cutoff), 35% of those categorized above were reassigned below when BMD was added. In contrast, only 10% of those categorized below were reassigned to the higher risk category when BMD was added. The net reclassification improvement was 5.5% (p<0.01). Two versions of this risk tool have similar AUROCs, but alternative assessments indicate that addition of BMD improves performance. Multiple methods should be used to evaluate risk tool performance with less reliance on AUROC alone.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve is often used to evaluate risk models.\"]}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. These results suggest that ICSS combined with d-amphetamine constitutes a useful model to explore the elation and increased hedonistic drive observed in bipolar patients and ultimately help to identify novel pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Service members or Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009107) within 2 years of blast exposure underwent structured interviews for mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and multiple mood and anxiety diagnoses. MTBI history and active PTSD were both common, additionally 61% had at least one post-deployment mood or anxiety disorder episode. Psychiatric diagnoses had a high degree of comorbidity. Most dramatically, depression was 43-times (95% CI\u2009=\u200911-165) more likely if an individual had PTSD. PCS symptoms were greater in those with post-deployment PTSD or mood diagnosis. However, neither mTBI nor blast exposure history had an effect on the odds of having PTSD, mood or anxiety condition. These findings support that psychiatric conditions beyond PTSD are common after military combat deployment with blast exposure. They also highlight the non-specificity of post-concussion type symptoms.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common muscular dystrophy in the pediatric population. The manifestations of this disease include progressive muscle weakness, gait dysfunction, and motor impairment, leading to a loss of ambulation by the age of 13\u2009years. Molecular diagnosis is the standard diagnostic tool for DMD. This study aimed to investigate disease progression and genetic patterns in Iranian ambulant boys and to find the correlation between genotypes and motor function phenotypes. This study was performed on 152 DMD patients. Clinical history, including the disease phenotype, steroid therapy, and the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) score, was taken for all the patients. Molecular diagnoses were confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and next-generation sequencing tests. A total of 152 Iranian DMD patients were examined in this study. The mean age at the time of disease onset was 4.04\u2009\u00b1\u20092.00\u2009years, and the mean age at diagnosis was 5.05\u2009\u00b1\u20092.08\u2009years. The mean age of ambulation loss was 10.9\u2009years. Contracture was reported in 38.9% of cases. In terms of age, the mean total NSAA score showed a peak at 4 years of age, with a mean NSAA score of 24. Annual changes in the NSAA score were determined for all cases, based on the mutation type and exon site. Deletion mutation was found in 79.1% of cases, duplication in 6.8%, nonsense in 12.8%, and splice site in 1.4%. The most common single exon deletion was exon 44 (5.3%), and the most common multiexon deletions were attributed to exons 45-50 and exons 45-52 (4.6%). The results did not indicate any correlation between the mutation type and age at the time of disease onset, loss of ambulation age, and wheelchair dependence; however, a significant association was found between contracture and mutation type. The results showed a significant difference in the NSAA score between the deletion and nonsense groups at the age of 3 years (P\u2009=\u20090.04). No significant correlation was found between the phenotype and exon site. Overall, 91.1% of the study population had a history of corticosteroid use, and 54.1% showed compliance with rehabilitation therapy.

Microexons are small sized (\u226451\u2009bp) exons which undergo extensive alternative splicing in neurons, microglia, embryonic stem cells, and cancer cells, giving rise to cell type specific protein isoforms. Due to their small sizes, microexons provide a unique challenge for the splicing machinery. They frequently lack exon splicer enhancers/repressors and require specialized neighboring trans-regulatory and cis-regulatory elements bound by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) for their inclusion. The functional consequences of including microexons within mRNAs have been extensively documented in the central nervous system (CNS) and aberrations in their inclusion have been observed to lead to abnormal processes. Despite the increasing evidence for microexons impacting cellular physiology within CNS, mechanistic details illustrating their functional importance in diseases of the CNS is still limited. In this review, we discuss the unique characteristics of microexons, and how RBPs participate in regulating their inclusion and exclusion during splicing. We consider recent findings of microexon alternative splicing and their implication for regulating the function of small GTPases in the context of the microglia, and we extrapolate these findings to what is known in neurons. We further discuss the emerging evidence for dysregulation of the Rho GTPase pathway in CNS diseases and the consequences contributed by the mis-splicing of microexons.

The chaperonin GroEL is a megadalton-sized molecular machine that plays an essential role in the bacterial cell assisting protein folding to the native state through actions requiring ATP binding and hydrolysis. A combination of medicinal chemistry and genetics has been employed to generate an orthogonal pair, a small molecule that selectively inhibits ATPase activity of a GroEL ATP-binding pocket variant. An initial screen of kinase-directed inhibitors identified an active pyrazolo-pyrimidine scaffold that was iteratively modified and screened against a collective of GroEL nucleotide pocket variants to identify a cyclopentyl carboxamide derivative, EC3016, that specifically inhibits ATPase activity and protein folding by the GroEL mutant, I493C, involving a side chain positioned near the base of ATP. This orthogonal pair will enable in vitro studies of the action of ATP in triggering activation of GroEL-mediated protein folding and might enable further studies of GroEL action in vivo.

In domestic ruminants, the stratification of forestomach contents - the results of flotation and sedimentation processes - is an important prerequisite for the selective particle retention in this organ. A series of anatomical and physiological measurements suggests that the degree of this stratification varies between browsing and grazing wild ruminants. We investigated the forestomach contents of free-ranging mouflon and roe deer shot during regular hunting procedures. There was no difference between the species in the degree by which forestomach ingesta separated according to size due to buoyancy characteristics in vitro. However, forestomach fluid of roe deer was more viscous than that of mouflon, and no difference in moisture content was evident between the dorsal and the ventral rumen in roe deer, in contrast to mouflon. Hence, the forestomach milieu in roe deer appears less favourable for gas or particle separation due to buoyancy characteristics. These findings are in accord with notable differences in forestomach papillation between the two species. In roe deer, particle separation is most likely restricted to the reticulum, whereas in mouflon, the whole rumen may pre-sort particles to a higher degree. The results suggest that differences in forestomach physiology may occur across ruminant species.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

It has recently been recognized that many patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) are anemic. The anemia is very often associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The more severe the anemia the more severe the CHF, with higher mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization rate. The only way to prove that the anemia is itself a causative factor in the progression of both the CKD and the CHF is to correct it. In this paper we review the results of published papers and some preliminary reports about correction of this anemia in CHF. These studies frequently showed that erythropoietic stimulating agents (ESA) with oral or IV iron often resulted in improvement in left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, dilation, and hypertrophy, stabilization or improvement in renal function, reduced hospitalizations, diuretic dose, mitral regurgitation, pulmonary artery pressure, plasma volume, heart rate, serum brain natriuretic peptide levels, and the inflammatory markers C reactive protein and Interleukin 6, and an improvement in New York Heart Association class, exercise capacity, oxygen utilization during exercise, sleep apnea, caloric intake, depression, and quality of life. The activity of endothelial progenitor cells was also increased. Iron deficiency may also play an important role in the anemia, because significant improvement of cardiac, renal, and functional status in these anemic CKD-CHF has been seen after treatment with IV iron alone. Clearly more work is needed to clarify the relationship between anemia, CKD and CHF.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"The anemia is very often associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD).\", \"The correction of anemia in patients with the combination of chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure may prevent progression of both conditions.\", \"Clearly more work is needed to clarify the relationship between anemia, CKD and CHF.\"]}"}]}

Obesity is a chronic disease that results in substantial global morbidity and mortality. The efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, a novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, in people with obesity are not known. In this phase 3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned 2539 adults with a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or more, or 27 or more and at least one weight-related complication, excluding diabetes, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive once-weekly, subcutaneous tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) or placebo for 72 weeks, including a 20-week dose-escalation period. Coprimary end points were the percentage change in weight from baseline and a weight reduction of 5% or more. The treatment-regimen estimand assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation in the intention-to-treat population. At baseline, the mean body weight was 104.8 kg, the mean BMI was 38.0, and 94.5% of participants had a BMI of 30 or higher. The mean percentage change in weight at week 72 was -15.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], -15.9 to -14.2) with 5-mg weekly doses of tirzepatide, -19.5% (95% CI, -20.4 to -18.5) with 10-mg doses, and -20.9% (95% CI, -21.8 to -19.9) with 15-mg doses and -3.1% (95% CI, -4.3 to -1.9) with placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). The percentage of participants who had weight reduction of 5% or more was 85% (95% CI, 82 to 89), 89% (95% CI, 86 to 92), and 91% (95% CI, 88 to 94) with 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg of tirzepatide, respectively, and 35% (95% CI, 30 to 39) with placebo; 50% (95% CI, 46 to 54) and 57% (95% CI, 53 to 61) of participants in the 10-mg and 15-mg groups had a reduction in body weight of 20% or more, as compared with 3% (95% CI, 1 to 5) in the placebo group (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). Improvements in all prespecified cardiometabolic measures were observed with tirzepatide. The most common adverse events with tirzepatide were gastrointestinal, and most were mild to moderate in severity, occurring primarily during dose escalation. Adverse events caused treatment discontinuation in 4.3%, 7.1%, 6.2%, and 2.6% of participants receiving 5-mg, 10-mg, and 15-mg tirzepatide doses and placebo, respectively. In this 72-week trial in participants with obesity, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of tirzepatide once weekly provided substantial and sustained reductions in body weight.

This work presents an update on the management of iron deficiency in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), either with or without anaemia. A review is made of the recommendations of the guidelines for the treatment of iron deficiency in CRF. It also presents new studies on iron deficiency in patients with CRF, as well as new findings about iron deficiency and its impact on clinical outcomes. Anaemia is a common complication of CRF, and is associated with a decrease in the quality of life of the patients, as well as an increase in morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency (absolute or functional) is common in non-dialysis chronic renal failure patients, and may cause anaemia or a low response to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. For this reason, the clinical guidelines for the treatment of the anaemia in Nephrology advise the correction of the deficiency in the presence of anaemia. Iron replacement therapy is indicated in patients with CRF and anaemia (Hb < 12 g/dL) in accordance with the guidelines. There is no unanimity in the indication of iron replacement therapy in patients with Hb>12 g/dL, regardless of whether they have an absolute or functional iron deficiency. Intravenous iron replacement therapy is safe, more efficient and rapid than oral therapy for achieving an increase haemoglobin levels and reducing the dose of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. For the administration of intravenous iron in non-dialysis chronic renal failure patients a strategy of high doses and low frequency would be preferred on being more convenient for the patient, better conserving of the venous tree, and on being safe and cost-effective. Iron plays an essential role in energy metabolism and other body functions beyond the synthesis of haemoglobin synthesis, for which the iron deficiency, even in the absence of anaemia, could have a harmful effect in patients with CRF. The correction of the iron deficiency, in the absence of anaemia is associated with functional improvement in patients with heart failure, and in muscle function or fatigue in patients without CRF. Despite the evidence of benefits in the correction of iron deficiency in patients with CRF, more studies are required to evaluate the impact of the correction of the iron deficiency in the absence of anaemia on morbidity and mortality, quality of life and physical capacity, as well as the long-term effect of oral and intravenous iron replacement therapy in this population.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"This work presents an update on the management of iron deficiency in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), either with or without anaemia.\", \"ron replacement therapy in the management of anaemia in non-dialysis chronic renal failure patients:\"]}"}]}

Necroptosis is a form of cell death characterized by receptor-interacting protein kinase activity and plasma membrane permeabilization via mixed-lineage kinase-like protein (MLKL). This permeabilization is responsible for the inflammatory properties of necroptosis. We previously showed that very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are functionally involved in necroptosis, potentially through protein fatty acylation. Here, we define the scope of protein acylation by saturated VLCFAs during necroptosis. We show that MLKL and phosphoMLKL, key for membrane permeabilization, are exclusively acylated during necroptosis. Reducing the levels of VLCFAs decreases their membrane recruitment, suggesting that acylation by VLCFAs contributes to their membrane localization. Acylation of phosphoMLKL occurs downstream of phosphorylation and oligomerization and appears to be, in part, mediated by ZDHHC5 (a palmitoyl transferase). We also show that disruption of endosomal trafficking increases cell viability during necroptosis, possibly by preventing recruitment, or removal, of phosphoMLKL from the plasma membrane.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"uring necroptosis.

The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

To identify potential risk factors associated with the incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following kidney transplant in a sample of patients from northern Mexico. Secondary analysis of data extracted from clinical files of patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2017 at Christus Muguerza Hospital in the city of Chihuahua. The final sample with complete data included 485 patients. ATN was diagnosed in 13.2% of patients using pathologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs from multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify predictors of ATN. Only 4 of 21 variables analyzed remained statistically significant in the final adjusted model. Cold and warm ischemia followed time-trend patterns with higher odds with longer ischemia times. For cold ischemia, compared with 0 to 240 minutes, ORs were 1.32 (95% CI, 0.49-3.51) for 241-480 minutes, 4.87 (95% CI, 2.29-10.3) for 481-960 minutes, and 10.0 (95% CI, 2.86-35.0) for > 960 minutes; for warm ischemia, compared with 40 to 59 minutes, these were 6.27 (95% CI, 1.95-20.8) for 60-70 minutes and 10.32\u00a0(95% CI, 1.95-54.4) for 71-110 minutes. Hypotension during surgery was associated with a higher chance of ATN (OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.97-50.9). When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57). The final model fitted well and explained 27% of the probability to develop ATN after a kidney transplant. Shortening the duration of ischemia and avoiding hypotension during surgery is essential to prevent ATN following a kidney transplant.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Cereblon (CRBN), originally identified as a gene associated with intellectual disability, was identified as primary target of thalidomide. Accumulating evidence has shown that CRBN is a substrate receptor of Cullin Ring E3 ubiquitin ligase 4 (CRL4) containing DDB1, CUL4, and RBX1, which recognizes specific neosubstrates in the presence of thalidomide or its analogs and induces their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. A set of small-molecule, CRBN-binding drugs are known as molecular glue degraders because these compounds promote the interaction between CRBN and its neosubstrates. Moreover, CRBN-based proteolysis-targeting chimeras, heterobifunctional molecules hijacking CRBN and inducing degradation of proteins of interest, have emerged as a promising modality in drug development and are being actively investigated. Meanwhile, the original functions and regulations of CRBN are still largely elusive. In this review, we describe key findings surrounding CRBN since its discovery and then discuss a few unanswered issues.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Cereblon (CRBN), originally identified as a gene associated with intellectual disability, was identified as primary target of thalidomide.\"]}"}]}

These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

We assessed AS patterns across pre- and postnatal development of seven organs in six mammals and a bird. Our analyses revealed that developmentally dynamic AS events, which are especially prevalent in the brain, are substantially more conserved than nondynamic ones. Cassette exons with increasing inclusion frequencies during development show the strongest signals of conserved and regulated AS. Newly emerged cassette exons are typically incorporated late in testis development, but those retained during evolution are predominantly brain specific. Our work suggests that an intricate interplay of programs controlling gene expression levels and AS is fundamental to organ development, especially for the brain and heart. In these regulatory networks, AS affords substantial functional diversification of genes through the generation of tissue- and time-specific isoforms from broadly expressed genes.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Our work suggests that an intricate interplay of programs controlling gene expression levels and AS is fundamental to organ development, especially for the brain and heart.\"]}"}]}

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health problem characterized by progressive kidney failure due to uremic toxicity and the complications that arise from it. Anemia consecutive to CKD is one of its most common complications affecting nearly all patients with end-stage renal disease. Anemia is a potential cause of cardiovascular disease, faster deterioration of renal failure and mortality. Erythropoietin (produced by the kidney) and iron (provided from recycled senescent red cells) deficiencies are the main reasons that contribute to CKD-associated anemia. Indeed, accumulation of uremic toxins in blood impairs erythropoietin synthesis, compromising the growth and differentiation of red blood cells in the bone marrow, leading to a subsequent impairment of erythropoiesis. In this review, we mainly focus on the most representative uremic toxins and their effects on the molecular mechanisms underlying anemia of CKD that have been studied so far. Understanding molecular mechanisms leading to anemia due to uremic toxins could lead to the development of new treatments that will specifically target the pathophysiologic processes of anemia consecutive to CKD, such as the newly marketed erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Uremic Toxins Affect Erythropoiesis during the Course of Chronic Kidney Disease: A Review.\"]}"}]}

However, designing potent PROTACs with desirable drug-like properties still remains a great challenge. Here, we report an updated online database, PROTAC-DB 2.0, which is a repository of structural and experimental data about PROTACs.

Kidney failure is known to cause anemia, which is associated with a higher risk of cardiac failure and mortality. The impact of milder decreases in kidney function on hemoglobin levels and anemia in the US population, however, is unknown. We analyzed a population-based sample of 15419 participants 20 years and older in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted from 1988 to 1994. Lower kidney function was associated with a lower hemoglobin level and a higher prevalence and severity of anemia below, but not above, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). Adjusted to the age of 60 years, the predicted median hemoglobin level among men (women) decreased from 14.9 (13.5) g/dL at an estimated GFR of 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) to 13.8 (12.2) g/dL at an estimated GFR of 30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) and to 12.0 (10.3) g/dL at an estimated GFR of 15 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). The prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin level <12 g/dL in men and <11 g/dL in women) increased from 1% (95% confidence interval, 0.7%-2%) at an estimated GFR of 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) to 9% (95% confidence interval, 4%-19%) at an estimated GFR of 30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) and to 33% (95% confidence interval, 11%-67%) at an estimated GFR of 15 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) among men and to 67% (95% confidence interval, 30%-90%) at an estimated GFR of 15 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) among women. An estimated GFR of 15 to 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) was present in 4% of the entire population and in 17% of the individuals with anemia.

We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Carvedilol suppressed apoptosis of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC through modification of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, whose was associated with an increase of Cav 1.2 protein expression.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Prosopagnosia is a type of visual agnosia with inability to identify faces, usually secondary to brain lesion in associative cortex areas, but there is also a congenital form known as developmental prosopagnosia. To describe a case of developmental prosopagnosia that illustrates the specificity of the pathways for perception of faces in the visual system. Also, we will describe possible mechanisms of recognition used by this patient. R.S., a 50 year-old woman, was referred for neuropsychological assessment due to difficulties in perception of familiar faces since childhood, unexplained by any loss of visual acuity. The exam showed good performance for comprehension, reasoning, concept formation, constructional abilities, criticism, judgment, mental control, memory and visual perception for other kinds of stimuli. No difficulties were seen regarding identification of ethnicity, age and types of animals. The patient was able to match celebrities' faces in different positions, but could not identify the matching pictures for unknown people. These findings indicate the patient had developed strategies, throughout life, to recognize familiar faces (relatives, celebrities) from memorized fragments, but still had difficulties in identifying non-familiar faces holistically.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Prosopagnosia is a type of visual agnosia with inability to identify faces, usually secondary to brain lesion in associative cortex areas, but there is also a congenital form known as developmental prosopagnosia.\"]}"}]}

Configurations using planar optical waveguides to produce such fields are shown here to present also a dramatic excitation irradiance enhancement at the guide/surrounding matter interface. We compare theoretically and experimentally a guided excitation with a classical external excitation. A full electromagnetic analysis predicts an irradiance increase higher than 10(4) for adequately tailored waveguides. We deposited high-index TiO(2) sol-gel waveguides on glass substrates according to best simulations. Quantitative enhancement analysis exploiting actual biological fluorescent spots perfectly confirms the irradiance amplification effect of a thin waveguide.

Evidence regarding the influence of coffee on appetite and weight control is equivocal and the influence of covariates, such as genetic variation in caffeine metabolism, remains unknown. Herein, we addressed the novel hypothesis that genetic variation in CYP1A2, a gene responsible for more than 95% of caffeine metabolism, differentially impacts the association of coffee consumption with appetite and BMI among individuals with different genetic predispositions to obesity. A cross-over randomized intervention study involving 18 volunteers assessed the effects of coffee consumption on dietary intake, appetite, and levels of the appetite-controlling hormones asprosin and leptin. Data on habitual coffee intake, BMI, and perceived appetite were obtained from an observational cohort of 284 volunteers using validated questionnaires. Participants were stratified according to a validated genetic risk score (GRS) for obesity and to the -163C\u2009>\u2009A (rs762551) polymorphism of CYP1A2 as rapid (AA), intermediate (AC), or slow (CC) caffeine metabolizers. Coffee consumption led to lower energy and dietary fat intake and circulating asprosin levels (P for interaction of rs762551 genotype*coffee consumption=0.056, 0.039, and 0.043, respectively) as compared to slow/intermediate metabolizers. High coffee consumption was more prevalent in rapid compared to slow metabolizers (P\u2009=\u20090.008 after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI) and was associated with lower appetite perception and lower BMI only in rapid metabolizers (P for interaction of rs762551 genotype*coffee consumption\u2009=\u20090.002 and 0.048, respectively).

While on foraging excursions, fiddler crabs track their burrow location despite having no visual contact with it . They do this by path integration, a common navigational process in which motion vectors (the direction and distance of animals' movements) are summed to form a single \"home vector\" linking the current location with the point of origin. Here, we identify the mechanism by which the integrator measures distance, by decoupling motor output from both inertial and visual feedback. Fiddler crabs were passively translated to a position such that the home vector lay across an acetate sheet on the ground. After being frightened, crabs tried to escape but slipped as they did so. Detailed high-speed video analysis reveals that crabs measure distance by integrating strides, rather than linear acceleration or optic flow: the number of steps they took depended on both the length of the home vector and how large their steps were, whether they slipped and fell short or not. This is the most direct evidence to date of a stride integrator that is flexible enough to account for significant variation in stride length and frequency.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression.

Under harsh environmental conditions, Caenorhabditis elegans larvae undergo arrest and form dauer larvae that can attach to other animals to facilitate dispersal. It has been argued that this phenomenon, called phoresy, represents an intermediate step toward parasitism. Indeed, parasitic nematodes invade their hosts as infective larvae, a stage that shows striking morphological similarities to dauer larvae. Although the molecular regulation of dauer entry in C. elegans involves insulin and TGF-beta signaling, studies of TGF-beta orthologs in parasitic nematodes didn't provide evidence for a common origin of dauer and infective larvae. To identify conserved regulators between Caenorhabditis and parasitic nematodes, we used an evolutionary approach involving Pristionchus pacificus as an intermediate. We show by mutational and pharmacological analysis that Pristionchus and Caenorhabditis share the dafachronic acid-DAF-12 system as the core endocrine module for dauer formation. One dafachronic acid, Delta7-DA, has a conserved role in the mammalian parasite Strongyloides papillosus by controlling entry into the infective stage. Application of Delta7-DA blocks formation of infective larvae and results in free-living animals. Conservation of this small molecule ligand represents a fundamental link between dauer and infective larvae and might provide a general strategy for nematode parasitism.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

Necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is characterized by the loss of membrane integrity and release of intracellular contents, the execution of which depends on the membrane-disrupting activity of the Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain-Like protein (MLKL) upon its phosphorylation. Here we found myofibers committed MLKL-dependent necroptosis after muscle injury. Either pharmacological inhibition of the necroptosis upstream kinase Receptor Interacting Protein Kinases 1 (RIPK1) or genetic ablation of MLKL expression in myofibers led to significant muscle regeneration defects. By releasing factors into the muscle stem cell (MuSC) microenvironment, necroptotic myofibers facilitated muscle regeneration. Tenascin-C (TNC), released by necroptotic myofibers, was found to be critical for MuSC proliferation. The temporary expression of TNC in myofibers is tightly controlled by necroptosis; the extracellular release of TNC depends on necroptotic membrane rupture. TNC directly activated EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway in MuSCs through its N-terminus assembly domain together with the EGF-like domain. These findings indicate that necroptosis plays a key role in promoting MuSC proliferation to facilitate muscle regeneration.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is characterized by the loss of membrane integrity and release of intracellular contents, the execution of which depends on the membrane-disrupting activity of the Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain-Like protein (MLKL) upon its phosphorylation.\"]}"}]}

When the recipients' age was 30 years or older, the probability also increased significantly (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.09-7.57).

Tirzepatide has the ability to reduce glycaemic levels, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce body weight, and improve lipid metabolism, which is critically important in T2DM. Tirzepatide administered by weekly subcutaneous injections appears to be a promising drug for the treatment of T2DM as well as cardiometabolic disorders.

The thymus is critical for central tolerance and diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire development, to provide lifelong defense against pathogens while maintaining self-tolerance. Peak thymic output occurs in utero, during infancy, and in early childhood, diminishing throughout life. Infants with congenital heart disease requiring sternotomy often undergo thymectomy to clear the surgical field. The long-term effects of early thymectomy are just being appreciated. Many patients remain asymptomatic despite immunologic findings mirroring those of immunosenescence. Few develop increased infection or lymphoreticular malignancy risk. When considering the effects of infant thymectomy, patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations may be instructive. These patients are lymphocytopenic, with increased early-onset infection and autoimmunity risk that is not seen in most patients who underwent thymectomy during infancy. The thymic structure of patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome or hypomorphic RAG is abnormal, with disrupted architecture inclining to perturbation of central tolerance. Similar findings may be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis, although disrupted peripheral tolerance may play a greater role in autoimmunity development. In conclusion, thymectomy during infancy may increase future risk of infection or autoimmunity, with premature immunosenescence mediated through disruption of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms initiated by early cessation or diminution of thymic output. Ideally, some thymic tissue should be preserved at the time of surgery.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

An initial screen of kinase-directed inhibitors identified an active pyrazolo-pyrimidine scaffold that was iteratively modified and screened against a collective of GroEL nucleotide pocket variants to identify a cyclopentyl carboxamide derivative, EC3016, that specifically inhibits ATPase activity and protein folding by the GroEL mutant, I493C, involving a side chain positioned near the base of ATP. This orthogonal pair will enable in vitro studies of the action of ATP in triggering activation of GroEL-mediated protein folding and might enable further studies of GroEL action in vivo.

Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), with its cyclin T regulatory subunit, is a component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, which stimulates transcription elongation and also functions in co-transcriptional histone modification, mRNA processing, and mRNA export. CDK9 also binds to cyclin K but the function of this CDK9-cyclin K complex is less clear. We and others have recently shown that CDK9 functions directly in maintaining genome integrity. This activity is restricted to CDK9-cyclin K. Depletion of CDK9 or its cyclin K but not cyclin T regulatory subunit impairs cell cycle recovery in response to replication stress and induces spontaneous DNA damage in replicating cells. CDK9-cyclin K also interacts with ATR and other DNA damage response and DNA repair proteins. CDK9 accumulates on chromatin and limits the amount of single-stranded DNA in response to replication stress. Collectively, these data are consistent with a model in which CDK9 responds to replication stress by localizing to chromatin to reduce the breakdown of stalled replication forks and promote recovery from replication arrest. The direct role of CDK9-cyclin K in pathways that maintain genome integrity in response to replication stress appear to be evolutionarily conserved.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), with its cyclin T regulatory subunit, is a component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, which stimulates transcription elongation and also functions in co-transcriptional histone modification, mRNA processing, and mRNA export.\"]}"}]}

Iron is vital for a vast variety of cellular processes and its homeostasis is strictly controlled and regulated. Nevertheless, disorders of iron metabolism are diverse and can be caused by insufficiency, overload or iron mal-distribution in tissues. Iron deficiency (ID) progresses to iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) after iron stores are depleted. Inflammation is of diverse etiology in anemia of chronic disease (ACD). It results in serum hypoferremia and tissue hyperferritinemia, which are caused by elevated serum hepcidin levels, and this underlies the onset of functional iron-deficiency anemia. Inflammation is also inhibitory to erythropoietin function and may directly increase hepcidin level, which influences iron metabolism. Consequently, immune responses orchestrate iron metabolism, aggravate iron sequestration and, ultimately, impair the processes of erythropoiesis. Hence, functional iron-deficiency anemia is a risk factor for several ailments, disorders and diseases. Therefore, therapeutic strategies depend on the symptoms, severity, comorbidities and the associated risk factors of anemia. Oral iron supplements can be employed to treat ID and mild anemia particularly, when gastrointestinal intolerance is minimal. Intravenous (IV) iron is the option in moderate and severe anemic conditions, for patients with compromised intestinal integrity, or when oral iron is refractory. Erythropoietin (EPO) is used to treat functional iron deficiency, and blood transfusion is restricted to refractory patients or in life-threatening emergency situations. Despite these interventions, many patients remain anemic and do not respond to conventional treatment approaches. However, various novel therapies are being developed to treat persistent anemia in patients.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"nemia of Inflammation with An Emphasis on Chronic Kidney Disease\"]}"}]}

Bipolar disorder is characterized by dysregulated motivation and increased hedonistic drive. d-Amphetamine induces manic symptoms in humans and exacerbates mania in bipolar disorder patients, effects that are counteracted by mood stabilizers. We utilized intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) to examine how lithium (LiCl), valproate (VPA) or their combination that is commonly used in the clinic affect brain reward function in rats, and how these drugs affect d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects. Acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LiCl (100, 200 mg/kg), VPA (400 mg/kg) or combined administration of subthreshold doses of LiCl (50 mg/kg) and VPA (200 mg/kg) increased ICSS thresholds. LiCl (100 mg/kg) and combined administration of LiCl and VPA (50 and 200 mg/kg), but not VPA alone (200, 400 mg/kg), attenuated d-amphetamine's reward-facilitating effects.

The X-protein of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is essential for virus infection and contributes to the development of HBV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a disease which causes more than one million deaths each year. Here we describe the design of a novel PROTAC (proteolysis targeting chimeric molecule) capable of simultaneously inducing the degradation of the X-protein, and antagonizing its function. The PROTAC was constructed by fusing the N-terminal oligomerization and C-terminal instability domains of the X-protein to each other, and rendering them cell-permeable by the inclusion of a polyarginine cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). It was predicted that the oligomerization domain would bind the X-protein, and that the instability domain would cause the X-protein to be targeted for proteasomal degradation. Addition of the PROTAC to HepG2 liver cancer cells, engineered to express full-length and C-terminally truncated forms of the X-protein, resulted in the degradation of both forms of the X-protein. A cell-permeable stand-alone form of the oligomerization domain was taken up by HepG2 cells, and acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor, causing inhibition of X-protein-induced apoptosis. In summary, the PROTAC described here induces the degradation of the X-protein, and antagonizes its function, and warrants investigation in a preclinical study for its ability to prevent or treat HBV infection and/or the development of HCC.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Here we describe the design of a novel PROTAC (proteolysis targeting chimeric molecule) capable of simultaneously inducing the degradation of the X-protein, and antagonizing its function.\"]}"}]}

Deficiency in or pharmacologic inhibition of factor XII, plasma kallikrein, high-molecular-weight kininogen, or the bradykinin B2 receptor, but not the B1 receptor, largely attenuated allergen/IgE-mediated mast cell hyperresponsiveness in mice. Reconstitutions of factor XII null mice with human factor XII restored susceptibility for allergen/IgE-mediated hypotension. Activated mast cells systemically released heparin, which provided a negatively charged surface for factor XII autoactivation. Activated factor XII generates plasma kallikrein, which proteolyzes kininogen, leading to the liberation of bradykinin. We evaluated the contact system in patients with anaphylaxis. In all 10 plasma samples immunoblotting revealed activation of factor XII, plasma kallikrein, and kininogen during the acute phase of anaphylaxis but not at basal conditions or in healthy control subjects. The severity of anaphylaxis was associated with mast cell degranulation, increased plasma heparin levels, the intensity of contact system activation, and bradykinin formation. In summary, the data collectively show a role of the contact system in patients with anaphylaxis and support the hypothesis that targeting bradykinin generation and signaling provides a novel and alternative treatment strategy for anaphylactic attacks.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"ol subjects.

Inhibitors of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have been increasingly used in head and neck cancer therapy and reported to improve the outcomes with an acceptable safety profile. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the benefit and risk of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients with head and neck cancer. The PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were systematically searched to find potentially eligible studies up to May 30, 2019. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and adverse events. Overall, this analysis consisted of nine eligible studies, with two randomized controlled trials and seven single arm trials. In the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, PD-1 inhibitors showed significantly lower relative risk of death than standard-of-care therapy (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a00.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44-0.82, I Programmed cell death-1 inhibitors prolonged OS in comparison with standard-of-care therapy in recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer patients.

Necroptosis is a programmed cell death pathway triggered by activation of receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), which phosphorylates and activates the mixed lineage kinase-like domain pseudokinase, MLKL, to rupture or permeabilize the plasma membrane. Necroptosis is an inflammatory pathway associated with multiple pathologies including autoimmunity, infectious and cardiovascular diseases, stroke, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Here, we describe protocols that can be used to characterize MLKL as the executioner of plasma membrane rupture in necroptosis. We visualize the process of necroptosis in cells using live-cell imaging with conventional and confocal fluorescence\u00a0microscopy, and in fixed cells using electron microscopy, which together revealed the redistribution of MLKL from the cytosol to the plasma membrane prior to induction of large holes in the plasma membrane. We present in vitro nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis using lipids to identify putative modulators of MLKL-mediated necroptosis. Based on this method, we identified quantitative lipid-binding preferences and phosphatidyl-inositol phosphates (PIPs) as critical binders of MLKL that are required for plasma membrane targeting and permeabilization in necroptosis.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": [\"Necroptosis is a programmed cell death pathway triggered by activation of receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), which phosphorylates and activates the mixed lineage kinase-like domain pseudokinase, MLKL, to rupture or permeabilize the plasma membrane.\"]}"}]}

To know whether carvedilol has any effect on apoptosis and ion channel remodeling of HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC, and comparing it with bisoprolol. We examined effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and ion channels as well as apoptosis of HL-1 cells transfected with E334K MyBPC using Western blot and flow cytometry. Carvedilol decreased the protein levels of p53, Bax and cytochrome c and increased that of Bcl-2 in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC. Bisoprolol failed to affect the protein levels. Both carvedilol and bisoprolol increased the protein levels of Cav1.2 but not that of Nav1.5. Carvedilol was stronger than bisoprolol at decreasing the number of annexin-V positive cells in HL-1 cells expressing E334K MyBPC.

There is longstanding interest in a purported relation between perfectionism and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but many previous studies have either inconsistently measured one of the constructs or not accounted for shared distress variance. These two studies investigated whether different measures of perfectionism showed unique correlations with obsessive-compulsive symptoms after accounting for depression and the cognitive domain of responsibility/threat estimation, which both are related strongly to OCD. Contrary to previous research, results were that both measures of perfectionism evidenced significant unique correlations with OCD beyond variance contributed by the other predictors. Further, the strength of association was substantially greater than the (statistically significant) perfectionism-depression partial correlation. Conversely, content conceptualized as \"adaptive\" perfectionism showed no correlation with any obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but had a significant negative correlation with depression. Possible reasons for both convergence and discrepancy with previous research are discussed.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}

With the discovery of the protein degradation mechanism of IMiDs, targeted protein degradation mediated by IMiDs via CRBN emerged and developed rapidly for the advantages of overcoming drug resistance and targeting undruggable. To date, almost all CRBN ligands are derived from thalidomide and there are few structural differences between them. Hence, we employed an accurate, effective, and rational approach to screen novel and potential CRBN ligands. In this study, we have built a molecular library by scaffold hopping with thalidomide. ADMET screening, virtual screening, and visual inspection screening\u00a0were performed step-by-step to screen the molecular library and five molecules were hit. Furthermore, docking analysis and a period of 150\u2009ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulation were performed to validate the accuracy of our screen. The docking results showed that molecular A (-10.42\u2009kcal/mol), molecular B (-9.73\u2009kcal/mol), molecular C (-9.25\u2009kcal/mol), molecular D (-9.09\u2009kcal/mol), and molecular E (-10.16\u2009kcal/mol) have lower binding energy than thalidomide (-5.42\u2009kcal/mol), lenalidomide (-5.74\u2009kcal/mol), and pomalidomide (-5.51\u2009kcal/mol). In the MD simulation, all the five screened molecules form key interactions with the active site amino acid residues (Trp380, Trp386, and Trp400) as well as the three marketed IMiDs. Besides, we found and explained that Pro352 was positive for ligand binding to CRBN and Glu377 in reverse, which has not been reported before.

Results showed that detection rate was 64.9% (467/720) in all the patients, gene deletion rate was 54.3% (391/720), and gene duplication rate was 10.6% (76/720).

In all the patients with gene deletion and duplication, the rate of DMD and IMD was 90.6% (423/467), and BMD, 9.4% (44/467).

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the prototype of primary humoral immunodeficiencies. Long-term follow-up studies regarding disease-related complications and outcome are scarce. Our aim was to describe the natural history of XLA. A nationwide multicenter study based on the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry was established in 2000 in Italy. Affected patients were enrolled by documenting centers, and the patients' laboratory, clinical, and imaging data were recorded on an annual base. Data on the patients (N\u00a0= 168) were derived from a cumulative follow-up of 1370 patient-years, with a mean follow-up of 8.35 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis decreased after establishment of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiency Network registry (84 months before vs 23 months after). Respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent clinical symptoms at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Regular immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduced the incidence of invasive infections. Affected patients developed chronic lung disease over time (47% after 40 years of follow-up) in the presence of chronic sinusitis (84%). Malignancies were documented in a minority of cases (3.7%). Overall survival for affected patients was significantly reduced when compared with that for the healthy male Italian population, and it further deteriorated in the presence of chronic lung disease. This is the first detailed long-term follow-up study for patients with XLA, revealing that although immunoglobulin replacement treatment reduces the incidence of invasive infections, it does not appear to influence the development of chronic lung disease. The overall survival of affected patients is reduced. Further studies are warranted to improve patients' clinical management and increase awareness among physicians.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"snippets\": []}"}]}
